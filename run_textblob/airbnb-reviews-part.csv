Had a great time in Abby's apartment would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Amsterdam and I'll definitely be staying there again when I come back! Thanks, Abby!"

The appartment is beautiful, spacious, very convenient and well situated. Esther, Rick and their friend Nora were very nice and welcoming (bottle of wine as welcome gift) ! We almost did every thing by foot to visit the city, the museums are just next to the flat and the nice places to have a walk and see the canals also. 
During the night we also stoped by some bars in the neigborhood and they were very fun ! 
My conclusion is, you will not be desapointed by this place, on the contrary you will be very pleased ! If I want to live in Amsterdam one day I will look for an appartment as pretty and well situated than Esther and Rick's appartment.
Sorry for my faults I'm french :-)

3470459;32049266;2015-05-13;6936924;Karina;"We had a great stay in Esther's home. It was everything that we needed for our young family. The portable cot was perfect and very comfortable for my baby and the high chairs were perfect for a baby and toddler. I was able to hire a bike from a good place 900m away and then ride to the RAI for my conference (under 10 min ride door to door).
Museum square very close and good playgrounds close by within walking distance. 
Supermarket round the corner was great, but just know that it doesn't open until 10am

Hema at the end of the street was a great shock to buy all sorts of basic supplies (equivalent of a target or big W store in Australia)
Courtyard was handy on nice days
Kitchen well equipped and lovely to be able to use staples- thanks!
Of course we left food we had bought too so its a "" pay it forward "" type situation!

We didn't meet Esther but Nora met us which was great. She answered any questions we had. 

We didn't realize that there was a cafe/bar right across the road but people were mainly smoking quietly inside versus drinking so they were never noisy at all. I could never smell smoke either. It was fine and we are quite particular with two young children. 

All in all it was everything we needed in a funky part of Amsterdam!!"
3470459;38258250;2015-07-14;11503921;Armelle;"Esther answered all our questions very quickly. It was very easy to exchange.
Her friend Nora welcomed us very warmly.
The house is very well located and the area is full of shops, bars and restaurants. It is clean, and there is everything you need for children. A very good adress."
3470459;70839973;2016-04-21;29945101;Laszlo;"Thank You for the opportunity to stay in Your home! 
We really enjoyed our stay especially the good location of the ap. and the little backyard.
Everything was OK and the majority of POI was reachable by walk. We can definitely recommend Your apartment for small groups and families.
Greetings from the Transylvanian team!"
3470459;82447720;2016-06-27;27784634;Leon;We stayed in Esther and Rick's house in Amsterdam for a weekend and had an amazing time. Everything is thought of, the house is super spacious and cosy. Very nice kitchen, although we didn't get down to using it :) comfortable beds, large rooms, excellent! Only nuisance are the neighbors on top, whose child woke us up at 6am each morning by stomping and running on the floor. But that's obviously nothing that Esther and Rick can control. All in all a great place.
3470459;116952241;2016-12-04;1029793;Federico;l'appartamento è bello, spazioso, in una bella zona e comodo per girare in centro ad Amsterdam. la cucina è grande e funzionale. C'è stato un solo grande difetto , e forse siamo capitati male, però l'interazione con l'host è stata davvero difficile.  una volta deciso un orario proposto da Esther, Nora, la sua amica che doveva portarci le chiavi non si è mai presentata, in compenso sua madre è arrivata con un'ora di ritardo senza parlare una parola di Inglese/spagnolo/tedesco/francese /italiano.  è davvero la prima volta che mi è capitata una cosa simile con Airbnb, ed è un peccato  perché la casa è davvero carina ma se l'interazione con l'host è complicata il risultato non è dei migliori.
3470459;124507495;2017-01-02;10072221;Kathrine;The house appartment was everything that er hoped for, when we as a group of 6 people visited Amsterdam for the New Years. Vety clean and nice acommadation, a nice kitchen and naturoplevelser and good communication. We would definetly come back another time.
6430582;41468894;2015-08-07;19716954;Veronika;A wonderful apartment in a great location! We loved it!
6430582;51285677;2015-10-19;190486;Susan;Wieke's modern flat is absolutely beautiful with tons of natural light and spotlessly clean. She leaves goodies and greetings for guests upon arrival. Wieke was a kind and responsive host in our first interactions. She helped me organize housing for my 10-person group, being especially kind and going herself to ask neighbours if they were also willing to rent out. However, Wieke had no house rules on her page. Her neighbours are were extremely sensitive to noise and not amenable to groups staying in their building. There seems to be an incongruity between Wieke's group-friendly spirit and the neighbours who encumber her. I would recommend this flat to a small family only and to those who do not intend to spend much time in the flat.
6430582;77058016;2016-05-30;22773503;Kris;"We had good communication in advance from Wieke and she was flexible to our initial request for a slightly early arrival time; and then responsive when our flight was delayed.

The apartment is as described: well designed and luxurious, but the description doesn't really do justice to the amount of space in the kitchen / living area. It really is a very lovely home.

Wieke left us a welcome pack with some local details and apart from a small misunderstanding around the use of bikes (which was easily rectified) - everything went exactly to plan.

The apartment is in a great area with lots of bars and restaurants and the FoodHallen at the end of the road was great for eating / drinking.

The only word of caution is that the apartment building is full of young families - this was perfect for us as we were travelling with two small children, but not the place to book if you want to have a party."
6307961;39346187;2015-07-22;38527703;Margriet;Heerlijk hotel in het centrum in authentieke stijl wat het extra gezellig maakt. Je kunt veel lopend doen. Wij waren er maar een nachtje, maar hadden graag nog langer willen blijven. Alles is precies zoals de advertentie aangeeft en je krijgt uitgebreide informatie vooraf als je reserveert over hotel, routebeschrijving en de stad om je heen. De mensen in het hotel zijn heel vriendelijk en behulpzaam.
6307961;41496896;2015-08-07;39908774;Laurence;"Très jolie adresse pas très loin de la gare centrale : belle chambre typique et très confortable avec une magnifique vue sur le canal.
Petit déjeuner ""comme à la maison"", et délicieux !
L'accueil est chaleureux et les hôtes sont ouverts, amicaux et de bons conseils.
Une très bonne adresse que je recommande. Nous y avons passer un très bon moment."
6307961;61618507;2016-02-06;4304159;Jennifer;It was a fantastic BnB right on the canal that was really perfect. Was just by the main train station and in the middle of great area to bike around. Perfect spot with a great breakfast as well. Would definitely go back.
6307961;97982256;2016-08-29;70120475;Elizabeth;Check in process was very convenient. Room was exactly as pictured, very clean and spacious. Beautiful canal view as promised and very central location.
6307961;121302948;2016-12-16;81407853;John;"Quaint hotel with pleasant outlook and location.
Highly recommended"
6307961;128902178;2017-01-28;110194634;Ivan;Pasamos una buena estancia, Daniel y Helen súper majos y el hotel tranquilo y bien situado. Muy buen desayuno. Gracias.
13145222;95236723;2016-08-19;23597526;Robert;"Vi fik en fin modtagelse af Hamid, da Jolanda selv var på ferie. God gennemgang af huset og kort og andre informationer vedrørende hvordan man kommer ind til City.
Hyggelig og afslappet Boheme atmosfære i huset, med masser af plads i det store fine køkken/alrum med udsigt til haven.
Alt i alt nogle dejlige dage. Tak for det :-)"
15373287;111626410;2016-11-01;21952391;M. G.;I have enjoyed my stay there, quiet place and very helpful host. It's 5 minutes walking distance from the Ganzenhoef Metro station, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps shows the wrong path so ask the host about direction when you come. Amsterdam central is 20 minutes metro ride. Overall, it's a good place to stay and I recommend it!
1008006;104370258;2016-09-26;43018131;Marcel;"Vielen Dank für alles!:) Es hat alles super geklappt. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber, das Bad sehr schön und die Lage sehr zentral (10Minuten zum Zentrum). 
Das einzig etwas negative ist die Anreise mit dem Auto, Amsterdam ist sehr teuer was das angeht (Parken pro Tag ca. 25€). Die Parkautomaten funktionieren dann aber ironischer Weise nur mit der Holländischen EC Karte,Deutsche Karten oder Kreditkarten gehen nicht - also, als Info, jedes Mal ein Anwohner um Hilfe bitten.:)"
1008006;137237611;2017-03-14;71749138;Rochelle;great houseboat experience.
1463449;10892916;2014-03-11;12716994;Avi;"Me and my friend stayed in Amsterdam for 6 nights.
The apartment is big, comfortable, nit and nicely decorated and had everything we needed in it (+cool Coffey machine). The host (Alexander) was very nice and helpful. He picked us up from the Central station at about midnight and took the time to explain us where we are and what attractions we have around (and how to get places etc.).
All in all we enjoyed our stay. The apartment is 3 Metro stops at most from everything that is interesting (anyway public transportation is very easy and fast).

Bottom line, I highly recommend the 'Beautiful Amstel River Apartment'.

1463449;32365627;2015-05-17;31070782;Martine;We really enjoyed our stay: the appartment is bright, very clean and corresponds to the description. It is very well situated, 5minutes  from tram and subway and very close to the center. Alexander is a great host, very nice and extremely helpful! Everything was just perfect! :-)
1463449;50375392;2015-10-11;20397284;Sandra;"we've just returned home after spending give days at Alexander's apartment. Alexander handled the booking swiftly and courteously and the arrangements for getting access to the property were seamless. The apartment was beautiful and spacious and just as described in the listing. It was located a 15-20 minute walk from the centre; a lovely walk along the river took you in to the main attractions. We ate breakfast locally but would highly recommend a local bakery called Bakhuys for wonderful freshly made on site pastries. De Ysbreker round the corner was a very good place to stop for a drink and snacks. We would highly recommend Alexander's apartment for those coming to Amsterdsm."

1463449;84697677;2016-07-08;7075026;Lena;The Amstel apartment is great - beautiful location and within easy reach of different restaurants, bars , the museum district and transport. The apartment is beautifully appointed and Alexander was a great host. Very communicative and gave us some excellent local recommendations for restaurants. Highly recommend.
1463449;102504436;2016-09-18;61200361;Woitek;This was my first AirbNb booking, and it was like the first kiss - sweat, romantic and with lot of atmosphere. Alexander is very polite and his help was great. The flat is nice and clean and everything was well prepared. The City center is close, we had bikes to dicover everything.
1463449;114378211;2016-11-18;25445444;Oleg;My stay at Alexander's apartment was perfect - starting with great communication before arrival and during my stay, and Alexander making sure that any of my needs were anticipated and fully met. The apartment is very clean, decorated in a very good taste, and overall very comfortable. Location was ideal for my needs. Overall, this was an exemplary Airbnb experience, and Alexander is a perfect host. Highly recommend!
1463449;135486652;2017-03-05;18055705;Sarah;"We have stayed for the week end at Alexander's place. The appartment is really well located near from transports in a quiet street close to the Amstel. The appartement is very nicely decorated and equipped with all you need. We felt so good that we didn't want to go out.
Just the perfect stay in Amsterdam."
4941689;81029149;2016-06-20;13233901;Marie-Charlotte;We enjoyed a lot our stay in Amsterdam. Veerle's appartement is located in a quite neighbourhood very close to the center with the metro. The flat itself is very cosy and spacious. Perfect for a couple. Moreover, Veerle left a few tips and maps for us and we discovered a very nice restaurant. Our weekend was just perfect
4941689;111701062;2016-11-01;1789463;Andrew;My wife, our 1yr old and I had a lovely weekend in Amsterdam and really enjoyed our stay in Veerle's apartment. Her place is hip and spacious while also warm and cozy, a perfect combination. The neighborhood is conveniently located between tram and metro lines in a quiet and green area with good options for eating and nearby shops. Check in and check out were both very easy and Veerle was really helpful with communication and her recommendations. We'll definitely recommend to friends in the future.
4941689;123656750;2016-12-30;15845224;Essi;"I really love the style of the apartment. Would stay here again. The place was rather quiet, as it was holidays the neighbours were having friends over and then you can tell that the walls aren't the thickest but the people living around are quiet, so no real problem there. Just don't be the one making noise yourself ;)
The location is good, walking distance to trams and a bit further away there's a subway stop. There are many nice restaurants and cafes nearby as well.
Going to the centre is easy with public transport, we didn't hire a bicycle that would've been maybe the best way to get around."
1744656;21712886;2014-10-22;19556707;Mikko;Lily was a great host! She knows the neighbourhood and gave us good tips. She also has good tips written down in a folder left in the apartment. The apartment is bigger than it looks in the photos. Good kitchen with all necessities, nice dining room and a sofa (+ tv). The mattresses in the bed were are very good. The area is nice! Metro stop is about 250m away and there are very good places to eat nearby. Bottom line is the place is better than it seems in Lily's ad!
1744656;90044318;2016-07-31;2881965;Tha;"Quel plaisir ce séjour chez Lily ! 
L'appartement est superbe, traversant, lumineux avec une douce vue sur l'Amstel. Il est suréquipé. Impossible de manquer de quoi que ce soit chez Lily qui a tout prévu, même un petit déjeuner pour votre arrivée ! 
Le quartier est calme, résidentiel, et offre de belles promenades le long de l'amstel et quelques terrasses qui se remplissent aux beaux jours.
Accessibilité au top avec metro et tram à deux pas. Et un chouette roof top au Volks Hôtel tout près pour aller boire l'apéro et diner (ou luncher).
Que du bonheur loin des sentiers battus et touristiques d'Amsterdam. On imagine que c'est là le vrai Amsterdam !"
1744656;108345435;2016-10-15;90113815;Alex;Everything was excellent. Lily met us when we wanted, her apartment is very nice and large, everything was as advertised. The location is fantastic, very close to several grocery stores, the subway, Amstel train station and restaurants. The view is very nice and it was very quiet at night. If you rent a bicycle, you are pretty much 10 minutes cycling from anywhere. I would highly reccomend renting here.
8436001;55297537;2015-11-29;39896053;Tobias;Nice cozy appartment waited for our group. We had everything we needed, the place was clean, Restaurants, supermarket, bus and tram around the corner. Additionally Jaymz was a very friendly host, which made our stay perfect. Thx
8436001;55808126;2015-12-06;19433005;Linda;Fantastic house for our group, large open living area with comfy beds. Very close to bars and shops and convenient for the tram to to the centre. Would definitely recommend and hope to stay there again.
8436001;60503720;2016-01-24;40234630;Carla;The appartment is well cut with open space, a nice little backyard and tasteful furniture. The location is not central but very well connected by bus or you can walk about 40 minutes to the city centre through nice parks. Internet worked well and Jaymz was helpful and accommodating. A small but essential negative note, the matress in the big room was terrible (should be replaced i suggest) and the tap in one bathroom was broken.
8436001;61659971;2016-02-07;53660723;Alexandra;Great apartment. Clean, modern and very well located to public transport and local shops. Hosts welcoming and hospitable. Would stay again!
13315099;96599209;2016-08-23;35996535;Henry;Great hosts, great area, great stay! Couldn't have asked for more.
13315099;101780859;2016-09-15;11649037;Tilghman;The host was very quick to communicate and gave great directions to the house.  Someone was there when we arrived to greet us and show us the house.  The space was gorgeous and perfect for 6 adults.  In a great neighborhood that's close enough to the tourist highlights of the city but still far enough away from the craziness.
14272591;100597375;2016-09-10;88577784;Adrian;Ginio was a very lovely and helpful host, and helped us carry our bags up the stairs. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was a decent size. Overall a very good stay for the price!
14272591;101182570;2016-09-12;8175078;Susan;Ginio was very responsive and helpful, the apartment was nice, clean, comfortable and full of character and I was very happy to stay there.  Lots of restaurants and cafes close by as well as just a few minutes walk from the RAI.  Most of all though, Ginio went out of his way to be as flexible as possible and help as much as he could.  He left some wine and fruit and came over quickly when I arrived to show me around and explain things.  I have found that AirBnB places are as much about the host as they are the place itself and I would highly recommend Ginio and his place!
14272591;107090641;2016-10-09;43501410;Laurent;"Un quartier calme et reposant, situé à distance raisonnable d'endroits intéressants. A recommander pour qui aime découvrir une ville en se promenant tout en étant au calme après une journée dense !
Notre hôte Ginio s'est montré agréable et charmant, n'hésitant pas à venir nous accueillir à l'arrêt du tramway et à nous accompagner dans la direction que nous souhaitions prendre au retour. Il s'est toujours montré réactif et à l'écoute. Un bon ambassadeur d'Amsterdam !"
2349446;12430955;2014-05-02;6389646;Hélène;Christine's Bedstay is a wonderful place! The room is so lovely and the brand new equipments satisfied all of our needs. If your having a trip to Amsterdam (alone or couple) and you want to be in a cute and quiet place away from the hustle and bustle of the tourists area, this is the place to be!
2349446;18331293;2014-08-25;18532503;Irith;"We hebben een zalig verblijf gehad in de ""Bedstay"". Een gezellige kamer met een tafeltje om je koffie of thee te drinken. Knus en proper en met een eigen badkamer. Echt een super accomodatie voor een weekendje Amsterdam. 10 minuten van het centrum af met een heel regelmatige tramverbinding."
2349446;19879064;2014-09-20;17164378;Phyllis;"Great spot outside of the busy city 
Easy to get to by one tram from central station- Sweet ,small, extremely clean cabin on unique grounds- wish we has stayed longer in that spot !!"
2349446;20009527;2014-09-22;15228455;Keri Anne;This was my favorite place we stayed on our whole 3 week European trip! I wish we could have stayed more than one night. We didn't get to meet Christine, but her lovely neighbor Evelien took wonderful care of us. This place is like a little wonderland just a few stops away from the central station. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water for the shower. We could sit on a bench in the yard to get the wifi signal. There were cool chickens and a a super cute cat to pet. The outside of the property is very hippie, artistic and rustic, while the inside of the tiny cabin seems designer and comfortable. Looks up the restaurant/cinema studio k which was pretty close by and a fun place to go!
2349446;30993469;2015-04-30;30157402;Alice;L'accueil a été très bon. Le logement était propre et joliment agencé comme sur les photos. A 5 minutes a pied de la station de tram et quatre stations pour aller en ville. Calme et en dehors des quartiers touristiques. Parfait pour un weekend en amoureux!
2349446;31804071;2015-05-10;2303932;Willemijn;Een uniek plekje in Amsterdam! We zijn zeer gastvrij ontvangen door Christine. Vooraf stuurde ze al de nodige informatie. In The Bedstay  had ze allemaal lekkere dingen in klaar staan, en koffie en thee, zoveel als je maar wil. Het is heel knus op een bijzondere plek. OV is super goed te doen om naar het centrum te komen.
2349446;32251993;2015-05-16;30558499;Dennis;Christine's cabin is an unexpected cozy pleasure just a 10 minute tram ride from Amsterdam's city center. It's a small amount of space, but probably not more so than any average hotel room, and for a better price you'll get a unique, romantic bedstay experience.
2349446;39644926;2015-07-25;36269549;Anna;"Christine was very friendly and welcoming. The Bedstay fulfilled all our Wendy-House fantasies - beautifully designed and spotlessly clean, with some lovely touches. The chest of drawers with all the little drawers filled with goodies is a stroke of genius. Nice bathroom with a good shower, extremely comfortable bed. Because lots of people had commented on the WiFi, we didn't bother to try, and only found the password as we were leaving (it's on the inside of the blanket box :) ). The neighbourhood was very quiet and felt rural for somewhere so close to a big city. Getting into town was very easy; just a few mins walk to the tram stop and then 10 mins to Central Station. Christine gave us some excellent recommendations for things to do in Amsterdam and a useful map. Would definitely go back to the Bedstay and will be recommending it to friends."
2349446;42757314;2015-08-15;14078949;Alida;"What a lovely, quaint and truly unique experience.  The Cosy Bedstay is exactly like all the other reviewers described...close and easy route to the  26 tram stop which takes 10mins in to central Amsterdam.  

The bed was very comfortable, the shower water hot and strong enough to rinse the shampoo thoroughly out of your hair.  The little chest of drawers were full of traditional dutch stroopwafels and organic chocolate, as well as an array of herbal teas and instant AND great filter coffee.  The host welcomed us with a small bottle of red wine and 2 small wine glasses, perched in the middle of a very cute table with 2 chairs.  She also added a warm personal touch with a silk sleeping gown for women and 2 pairs of very cozy sheep skinned slippers.  Good quality products are provided, eg shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and enough towels and linen.  Its quiet at all times...very peaceful, and if you're in to eco sustainable buildings, this artists commune is definitely worth a stay at.

Thank you Christine!! Your hospitality was superb and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience at The Cosy Bedstay.  We have already recommended it to our frinds.  Hope to meet again soon"
2349446;47055523;2015-09-15;38680600;Emily;When we got to the bed stay we were surprised how easy it was to get there, ten minutes on the tram from centraal station and a three minute walk from the tram stop. The bed stay looks exactly like the pictures, small, cosy, well presented and beautifully decorated. Christine lives just next door so is able to help you out if you need it. She was welcoming and gave us a map. We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to friends and family. Thank you Christine! X
2349446;55904156;2015-12-07;45729438;Carley;Wow what an amazing find! Christine was a great host, meeting us upon arrival, giving us maps & telling us about things to see in the local area. The bedstay was set in a tranquil and quirky location, really simple to get too and away from all the hustle & bustle of central Amsterdam. The bedstay was warm and cosy & perfect for a winter weekend away!! Christine also stocked up on a selection of teas, coffees & also some treats, which was a really sweet touch (and we're now addicted to stroopwafels!) - Thanks for a great stay, we will definitely be back!!
2349446;64182715;2016-02-29;11152731;Kanut;"We had a great weekend in Amsterdam including two nights at the bedstay. The little hut is really cute. :-) Christine made sure we had a warm and welcoming place for the night. The area makes you feel like being far outside the city centre, when actually it's just a five minute walk and ten minutes by tram to get to the central station. We will probably visit again!

PS: If you happen to be a basketball player or something and taller than two meters, you might want to consider looking for another place to stay. As cosy as it is, the ceiling isn't too high. Was perfectly fine for me (1,90), though - the one place where I was most likely to bang my head was even protected by some kind of cloth. :-)"
2349446;74298291;2016-05-14;7308097;Rafaela;The cosy Bedstay is really nice and  lovely renovated! We slept very well in the bed and with the things in the little cupboard to prepare tea or coffee it was easy to have a little breakfast. Christine gave us some cards and a lot of information where to go in the city or out into the beautiful landscape- it was rather nice to talk to. I recommend this pretty nice place to go to!
2349446;91680848;2016-08-06;42435959;Marius;Had a great time at the bedstay. Was a very cozy and warm experience. Christine the host was super friendly. Even Transportation to the Centraal Station was very fast.
2349446;97266480;2016-08-26;38863306;David;The bedstay is a very nice place to stay 3,4 days. It is a bit far from the city center, but by tram you can be there in few minutes. Highly recommend !!!

2349446;105746638;2016-10-02;60951160;Caroline;Klein maar super romantisch plekje, rustig gelegen, OV op loopafstand. Gratis parkeren is ook erg fijn in Amsterdam!
2349446;116315743;2016-11-29;96919541;Leonie Elisabeth;It was just beautiful! The Bedstay is like the perfect place to stay ever: it´s cozy and clean, you can get there easily by car and park in front of the cabin, the Central Station is only like 4 stations away plus the nature around the bedstead is worth being seen as well. And the best part is there was tea and snacks!!!! Christine is very friendly and helpful which made the stay even more perfect! The Bedstay really felt like home.
2349446;123433590;2016-12-29;31980944;Julia;"The stay at Christines hut was perfect.
Maybe winter is not the best time for staying in a little hut. Because it was a little bit freeze sometimes. But it had its  advantages aswell!! The cute and cosy bed was the highlight! 
The way to the citycenter was very easy and short. That was awesome!


We hope you will have many more guests!! 
Best regards!

8084800;78983820;2016-06-10;11894871;Rick;Went that extra mile to make us feel welcome and know about what is going on in the local areas such as food restaurants to eat at and things to do.
8084800;111610367;2016-11-01;6277715;George;"We were made to feel very welcome. The facilities on the boat are great and to a great standard. Shower is fantastic.

Great access to the rest of the city and with some great restaurants right on the doorstep."
8084800;115619535;2016-11-26;90033713;Matthew;10/10. Lovely houseboat and great location!
8084800;122854128;2016-12-26;5934443;Geoff;We're sad to be leaving Amsterdam and the wonderful houseboat where we spent Xmas. A lovely and unique place to stay in what we think is the best location in town (this after have lived here a year). Olaf & Mark were easy to coordinate with and also quite accommodating--even when a delayed flight had us check in a couple hours late. Hope we can return soon!
2823740;82972798;2016-06-30;26609462;Richard;"The apartment was very spacious and well equiped fitting the description of the best of both worlds in its location to the large neighbouring park, yet located in Amsterdam itself. Having bikes provided was another big plus. 
     The kitchen had many extras such as herbs,spices,jams and much more, that made saying there a real pleasure."

5923608;69472261;2016-04-11;58245486;Bárbara;Adoramos a nossa estadia em Amesterdão e o barco foi sem dúvida uma experiência diferente. A Marcelle é muito simpática e disponível para nos ajudar, assim como a sua família. Obrigada!!

NO SE TARDA NADA EN LLEGAR AL CENTRO DE AMSTERDAM. HA SIDO UNA EXPERIENCIA IRREPETIBLE"
579851;6617220;2013-08-19;2235073;Gunvor;"I spent a weekend with my boyfriend in Amsterdam and I really wanted it to be special and romantic for us. Renting the Tasmania was the best thing I ever tried! It is so light, friendly, open og central. We swam in the canal, we rode the bicycles and we tried the kajaks. On arrival Sonja had left a bottle of champagne in the fridge, which was a very nice gesture. There was also some bread, cheese, jam, and yoghurt for breakfast the next morning. We slept like engels and we had peace and quiet around us. It really was one of the best experiences I ever had from just one weekend.
I can highly recommend the Tasmania to anyone who is thinking on going to Ams and want it to be a bit more special than just a normal, boring hotelroom. This is the way to do it!! 
We already decided that we are coming back - sometime soon hopefully.
Michael and Sonja are very sweet and welcomming hosts. We felt right at home from the first moment."
579851;7603852;2013-09-26;5346340;Margaret And Peter;I simply cannot say enough about this accommodation. What an experience! The houseboat is beautiful, and our time on the Tasmania absolutely exceeded our expectations. The room is large, the bathroom is exquisite, and the boat is wonderful. Sonja put a lot of care into leaving local food and beverages in the mini-fridge, which made for wonderful breakfasts during our stay. My husband and I spent many hours sitting on the top of the boat marveling at the beauty of our surroundings. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here!! It was a major highlight of our European trip.
579851;12972692;2014-05-16;12112915;Jenna;We really enjoyed our stay at Sonja and Michals houseboat. It was the perfect place to come home to after a long day of sightseeing, and an especially perfect place to crash after arriving in Amsterdam tired and jet lagged. The cabin was stocked with snacks and drinks, and the pictures did the place great justice. They have everything you need to get around, including maps, guides and bikes! An amazing couple of days, thanks for a great time!!
579851;13778956;2014-06-04;3753255;Nicola;"We arrived for our four night stay and were greeted by Sonja who showed us round their wonderful boat. Our accommodation was so comfortable and the bed was heavenly.  During our stay we had utter peace and Sonja was extremely generous leaving us various items of food and drink including a fresh delicious loaf of bread and various other treats, along with a gorgeous bunch of fresh flowers.
We were able to experience the best of Amsterdam without being exposed to all the tourist tat.  The Jordaan is charming and the little shops and cafés are excellent.  We treated ourselves to dinner at BAK restaurant nearby and would highly recommend it.
We were able to walk to and from Centraal Rail
station with our bags within 20 minutes.  We also enjoyed using the bikes to get around.
If you like a peaceful time in a beautiful setting, where you can watch the boats come and go, stay with Sonja and Michael, you will not be disappointed. We very much look forward to returning again one day soon.

Many thanks again to you both for a wonderful boat experience."
579851;14190602;2014-06-14;15104554;Michelle;We had the most wonderful time on the Tasmania. Sonja was there to receive and welcome us even though our flight was almost 3 hours delayed. She and family live at the back of the Tasmania, but you will have absolute privacy. Sonja's place is so clean, and well equipped with food, guidebooks and comfortable little touches that you won't need any more. The Tasmania is located very near public transportation, yet the surrounding area is peaceful and picturesque. Highly recommended!
579851;17089100;2014-08-07;4300322;Annick;"Living some days with Sonja on the housboat was a great experience. The location is close to the city but it is a very quiet place. Sonja borrowed us two bikes so we saw a lot of lovely corners and we were undependent of public transport. Thanks again!
On the houseboat we had everything we needed: some food for breakfast, beverages, maps... 
I really recommend to stay at the Tasmania!"
579851;18303295;2014-08-25;15484566;Sabrina;We spent two days and nights on the Tasmania and had an absolutely amazing time. The house boat is dream-like (which helped a lot during bad weather since it rained a lot) with everything you might want (comfy bed, fresh towels, nice shower, DVDs, ......). Sonja was an amazing host. Before we arrived, we received a lot of information on how to find the boat and where to go for dinner etc.. We arrived early in the morning and everything was ready. We had a full fridge with everything you need including breakfast items, sparkling wine, grapes, biscuits, a yummy fresh bread and tea/coffee - thanks again - we really appreciated that. The boat is easy to find and perfect for walks and bike rides into town. What more could you want?
579851;19189109;2014-09-08;15561638;Ellen;"Sonja's houseboat was a dream to stay on. She was there to greet us and show us around the boat. She was so sweet and provided fresh flowers, bread and a stocked mini fridge for our arrival.  This was great to walk into as I was feeling a bit under the weather when we first arrived. 

There was a fantastic binder she had put together of the most popular Amsterdam attractions, a list and map of her favorite restaurants in relation to the Tasmania. We throughly enjoyed our stay and using the bikes Sonja provided. I couldn't imagine exploring Amsterdam any other way. We will definitely be coming back, hopefully in the near future! Thanks again for the hospitality!"
579851;19358611;2014-09-11;3571378;Anna;Fantastic! The boat is incredible. It's modern and comfortable and Sonja was a great host. The location is a bit removed from the city center, but the bikes helped. It was also quiet, which we loved. Definitely recommend this!
579851;22946602;2014-11-18;1174944;Marc & Sophie;"The Tasmania boat is SO GREAT ! Peaceful, elegant, clean... We really enjoyed our stay in Sonja's boat and we enjoyed a lot her way of communication and reception. Easy to contact, nice food and wine when we arrived. 
We warmly recommend her... Thank you Sonja"
579851;27365568;2015-03-02;2375505;Nicolin;"Fantastic weekend in Amsterdam!
The boat is cozy and very special, the hosts very welcoming (details in the fridge were really appreciated) and the location perfect.
We really enjoyed taking the provided bikes for long strolls around the fantastic city.
Overall a big thumb up for the complete package."
579851;28515326;2015-03-25;26090926;Mylene;Merci à Sonja et Michael pour leur gentillesse. Le bateau était tout simplement magnifique et fonctionnel. Nous avons pu découvrir Amsterdam grâce aux vélos prêtés.
579851;28705351;2015-03-29;26732087;Karis;We love the place. It was cozy and Sonja was really helpful. She provided us a great place to stay. I would recommend staying in Tasmania. Good experience!
579851;28924507;2015-04-01;17633068;Bernhard;"Wunderbare Unterkunft an perfekter Lage!
Haben uns von Anfang an sehr wohl und super betreut gefühlt."
579851;37136140;2015-07-05;13127487;Marwan;This was probably the nicest place I stayed at in Amsterdam so far, and I will be back. Sonja is awesome, she really thought of every detail and it's so easy to live there. The boat is extra clean, comfortable, quite and relaxing. Thank you for your great hospitality. Looking forward to spending more days here in the future.
579851;44574469;2015-08-27;18839392;Susan;We loved our stay on the house boat!  Such a thrill!  I was concerned the boat might rock - but was so thrilled we couldn't even feel we were on water. It was a very doable but slightly steep flight of stairs to get to our room - such luxury and comfort!  Loved looking at the stars through the skylight as we lay in bed. Would recommend people try the bikes. Such a faster way to get around the city!   Stay here- it will be the most unique experience in Amsterdam!
579851;54701968;2015-11-23;24453563;Jamie;My fiancé and I had a great stay on the Tasmania.  The boat itself was a lot bigger in real life than expected, as what the room, which was very spacious. The room was clean, warm, modern and comfortable. It had everything we needed including towels, hairdryer, cutlery, microwave, kettle, coffee machine etc. Sonia had also left us some bubbles, crisp, bread, jam, butter, milk and cheese which was very kind. Michael was very helpful and gave us the bikes to use and directions to a good place to eat. The bikes are the best way to get around Amsterdam and it's a bonus that they come as part of the  booking as it saves having to hire them. Staying on the boat was a unique experience and was a great base to explore the beautiful city of Amsterdam. Would love to go back one day...
579851;56640690;2015-12-15;50853165;James;"Staying at Sonja's was a treat; the boat is beautiful and comfortable and located conveniently. It was easy to find and in a safe area. Bikes were great to use and the place was very clean. Sonja was a very helpful host and I'd definitely stay again. Do not hesitate to book!"
579851;61934501;2016-02-09;50287775;Katja;Ankommen und sich wohlfühlen - einfach wunderbar! Sonja ist ein wundervolle Gastgeberin, das Boot/das Zimmer einfach nur großartig, ich komme aus dem schwärmen gar nicht mehr raus! Ich werde ganz sicher wiederkommen, aber diesmal nicht alleine!! Auf dem Boot ist es so wunderbar ruhig. Zu Fuß bis zum Bahnhof durch die Haarlemermerstraat ist kurzweilig und immer einen Gang wert.
579851;62492728;2016-02-15;48937568;Solange;"Le séjour à bord du Tasmania a été une expérience formidable ! Nous avons été accueillis chaleureusement par Sonja, qui a su nous mettre à l'aise avec sa gentillesse, son sourire, et son français ( car nous ne parlons pas anglais !)
Le studio est magnifique, conforme aux photos, propre et très bien entretenu. Sonja avait garni la kitchenette (pop corn, gâteaux spécialité au miel d Amsterdam,yaourts, fromage, lait, jus de fruit, bières, champagne, eau gazeuse et Plate, disette de café, thé...). Inutile de porter votre gel douche et vos serviettes. Tout y est !! Un vrai bonheur.
Il est d un calme solennel ce qui fut très agréable. Un dépaysement total.
Nous n'avons pas eu le loisir de connaître un peu plus notre hôte, car nous partions du matin jusqu'au soir, mais nous avons suivi ses conseils avisés pour nos visites. Il y a dans le studio des guides de voyage sur Amsterdam et Sonja tient à jour un portfolio  complet avec restaurants visites et itinéraires. De la gare,  il faut compter 20 min à pied en marche rapide.
Une adresse à retenir dans son calepin. 
Si nous devions donner un conseil: juste préciser aux futurs visiteurs L itinéraire avec le numéro du bus et le nom de l arrêt de bus pour se rendre au Tasmania, et peut être une notice explicative pour la TV. Mais cela reste superflus.
Merci encore pour cette fabuleuse expérience.
Je ne manquerais pas de donner cette adresse à quiconque me demandera où séjourner sur Amsterdam. Un séjour inoubliable pour nous.
Allez y les yeux fermés !!!"
579851;66664340;2016-03-24;49343564;Lydia;"We booked the first time about Airbnb and because of the great experience not the last time . The ambiance on the Tasmania is unique and very special. The surrounding area has much to offer and Sonjas tips are worth gold. The expectations were more than exceeded and Sonja is a great hostess! We would go back anytime. 
Heel hartelijk bedankt Sonja!"
579851;69567909;2016-04-11;9214496;Maria;We had 4 days at Sonja's boat and we simply loved it. Beautiful studio, incredibly friendly host, clear instructions and stocked small kitchen: all that made our stay easy and pleasant.:) Great experience , highly recommend for anyone ! Loved evenings with wine on the deck watching sunset as well!
579851;104874647;2016-09-29;33043790;Daniel & Sarah;What a wonderful and unique air bnb experience! Lovely and cosy studio with comfy bed and very clean facilities. Sonja left us some really good recommendations and also lots of breakfast goodies :) would definitely recommend to others and would stay on the Tasmania again when visiting the beautiful city of Amsterdam :)
11648499;105783702;2016-10-02;57917555;Anna;Patrick is a fantastic host! He greeted us warmly, explained everything, and even gave us Dutch caramel waffles! The studio is very clean, modern, private and quiet. It's right next an amazing brunch spot called Little Collins, really great healthy food. The location is perfect, away from the crazy touristy center, but walking distance to all the museums and restaurants and next to a tram. There's also a huge market/bazar next to the studio where you can find pretty much anything you can think of. Watch out for junk though. The area is charming. One thing to note is that the studio is like 5 flights of VERY steep stairs up, so don't bring huge luggage and it's probably not for the elderly or people with arthritis in the knees. Other than that everything is wonderful. Enjoy!
11648499;113099994;2016-11-10;23429152;Moy;IT WAS GREAT TO STAY AT PAT´S APARTMENT.  REALLY CUTE, NICE VIEW. A CHARMING ROOM, VERY CONTFORTABLE, CLEAN AND COSY. ITS EXCELENTE FOR TWO PERSONS. I REALLY RECOMEND THIS AMAZING STUDIO.
11648499;115010082;2016-11-21;22510542;Richard;The apartment was perfect. Clean and modern. Located close to everything.  Our host was great and gave details to get around and the restaurant recommendations were fantastic. Will definitely be recommending to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.
11648499;120052178;2016-12-07;23106490;Helene;"Le logement est conforme à sa description. Le lit est vraiment très confortable, le studio décoré avec goût, on se sent tout de suite chez soi.
Si on y ajoute sa situation dans un quartier agréable et vivant, et à quelques pas du quartier des musées, cela en fait une location ... exceptionnelle !
L'accueil chaleureux de Patrick ajoute encore un + à cette location !
Une adresse que je garde précieusement."
11648499;135765202;2017-03-06;80919683;Nick;Beautiful, quiet, and well stocked apartment perfectly located in De Pijp. Patrick is very friendly and great with communication. Highly recommended both Patrick and his place!
3871631;18451731;2014-08-26;4377382;Yuval;Monique and Rini are a really cool couple who live in one of amsterdam's greatest apartments! We were four people and the apartment fitted perfectly- each one of us had his space. The location is also really good. It might not be in Dam square but it's actually a plus, since it was a cool and quiet residential area and still close to the center. Monique and Rini picked us up from the tram station and showed us the way home. The apartment was stocked with everything we needed, including food and shower supplies, and even cheeses and wine on the living room table! We were very lucky to have found this apartment and will definitely stay there again next time.
3871631;49312520;2015-10-03;32178973;Caryn;Amazing apartment! This place is beautiful and in a really cool neighborhood. We stayed here with another couple and had a great time. We walked to all the sights, and there were a ton of good restaurants nearby. Our room was surrounded by windows and was an amazing place to wake up to every morning. Plus, what could be better than drinking yummy beer on a roof deck? Monique was really great as well, and she made us feel very welcome! A++
3871631;67375760;2016-03-29;48479375;Yosi;The flat is gorgeous. Everything about the flat is perfect. The location not too far away from city centre yet close to the tram station as well. There is a massive music collection if you are interested. Also we were speechless with the terrace. Communication was also great with her. Strongly recommend and if we ever come back to Netherlands we will be coming back to flat.
3871631;96131870;2016-08-21;21763890;Jane;"Although Monique was on holiday when we arrived, her lovely neice let us in and explained everything we needed to know. The flat looks better than in the photos and the location is fantastic.
We easily walked to many of the things we wanted to do, the supermarket is a stones throw away, as are other smaller shops to buy whatever produce you fancy. 
The tram stop is just around the corner from the flat and each tram has a helpful conductor sitting in their own booth in the tram, so  if you're a bit unsure about how the system works, they can easily help you out.
Also, the Vondelpark is a short walk away and has something going on nearly every evening, great take-away food and is so laid back it's horizontal.
Enjoy your time here, we certainly did."
11582455;77981402;2016-06-04;308818;Desigan;What a fantastic and quirky split level home almost in the heart of De Pijp area. The tranquil back yard was perfect for a love glass of wine at the end of a long day. Restaurants, bars and ice-cream parlours are within walking distance. That includes supermarkets from Lidl and Albert Heijn. The #4 tram (with the #16 a little further away) is perfect for getting downtown or central station. And if you're interested in the hustle and bustle of Albert Cuyp market it's literally 5 minutes away. Zazi - your feline host is also most entertaining and no overhead at all.
11582455;80297169;2016-06-17;342616;Adrian;While the garden was charming, the house had an overpowering smell of cat urine. Half the house was unusable, due both to the smell and the amount of cat hair everywhere. The cat also seemed unhappy with the situation. The agents involved seemed to have little idea about the cat and her needs. A disappointing experience!
7138728;41003255;2015-08-03;11015800;Romain;"L'appartement d'Andrew est un charmant appartement familiale, fidèle au descriptif et aux photos, idéal pour un couple avec 1 ou 2 enfants! Andrew avait mis à notre disposition quelques notes pratiques pour visiter la ville et se familiariser avec son appartement, et nous avait réservé une gentille attention à l'arrivée.
 Proche du métro, de la gare, et surtout dans un quartier très sympa, nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce séjour, que nous avons passé avec ma femme, mon tout jeune bébé et mes beaux-parents!
Le jardin est vraiment agréable et apporte un vrai plus :) Nous recommandons chaudement l'appartement des Hastie, et merci encore à Andrew pour sa bonne communication. Nous reviendrons avec plaisir lors d'un prochain voyage à Amsterdam!"
6129667;33048816;2015-05-24;33760043;Arjan;Super friendly host Ivan was. He really made us feel like we should treat his home like our own. Loved the location and although really close to all the busy places, it was really quiet and comfortable. Would definitely stay at Ivan's place again and would not hesitate to recommend staying here.
6129667;45593785;2015-09-04;34482567;Chris;We only met Robert briefly as we were just in his place for one night, but what a nice guy. He welcomed us into his home with a bottle of wine and lovely hand written note. His place is very clean, comfortable and fully renovated. It's a short walk to the train station and close to great food and shopping. We'd certainly recommend staying with him.
6129667;47877069;2015-09-21;44002658;Rachel.Y;"i had a wonderful experience. ivan is very kind and made us feel at home. the room is sweet and clean. house is fabulous, i really love it. definitely gonna come back if i traveled to europe again;) highly recommend."

The apartment is superb in such a great location/area with the most wonderful art all created by Robert. 

Would love to stay here again when in Amsterdam!"

The neighbourhood was nice and convenient."
6129667;81997118;2016-06-26;38427771;Virginia;"We had an amazing time in Robert's house! He is a really fantastic host, we looked for a house only the day before our arrival and he responded us immediately! 
He made us feel like home from the first time, everything was perfect and the welcome was really great (water for the night and also a bottle of wine) considering also our arrival at 1am, he founded a solution to make us a simple way to take the keys. 
We've been at home only to sleep because of our short stay in Amsterdam but it could not be better than this!
If I have to come back here I will try to book this room again certainly!
Thank you Robert!!

13014261;106474578;2016-10-06;8110704;Revecka;Sammy's flat is situated close to the tram and bus lines making it easy to get to the center of Amsterdam (10-20min). There are tons of cool restaurants and bars within a 5-10 minute walk (Bar Botanique and Walter's were amazing). The area is trendy, quiet and easy to navigate around. There is a train line less than 5 minutes away that can take you either to the airport or to Amsterdam Centraal Station, which was super convenient. There is a grocery store a block away, and if needed a pharmacy as well. The Nespresso machine was a nice little touch. Communication was on point and directions/instructions were clear. I would stay at Sammy's again in a heartbeat.
13014261;124646895;2017-01-02;104386060;Emma;Great apartment, located next to multiple travel options including bus/tram/train. Thank you Sammy for a wonderful stay!
13014261;128768650;2017-01-27;45541329;David Ocargo;"Place is super nice, ,full of details.
Just a short ride to city centre! There are supermarkets around and you can cook your own food in the kitchen! Very nice place"
13014261;132739918;2017-02-19;2174890;Paul;Nice apartment located short distance from trains to Amsterdam central. Host was quick to respond to all messages and helped us with a late check in. Highly recommended!
13014261;135481130;2017-03-05;46043438;Emily;"Great place in a really cool area about 35 mins walk into town and around 12 euros in a taxi back at night. Some good places to eat and cool little boutique shops around the local area, reminiscent of east London. So nice to be out of the main central area and live like a local. 

Nice to have a balcony and fresh air which feels very private, one benefit of the top floor is it's really quiet.

Small bedroom but lovely open space/living area and well designed, the owner clearly built a lot of it himself and he has a good eye for design.

The shower drain needs addressing as it leaks onto the bathroom floor (but not out of the bathroom) and smells a little. 
Unfortunately we couldn't get the TV to work either.

Otherwise great place, good location and really nice to see the east side of Amsterdam, would definitely choose this area again."
10775488;63504510;2016-02-23;36648979;Carolina;Simply fantastic! Ali has been very reactive, nice and helpful! We arrived quite late in The evening, He has waited us and He even offered to order some take away food for us. The apartment is perfect: well fournished, Clean, spacious and Bright. Equipped of Everything (tv, stereo, Cofferati machine, hair dryer etc.) It is also well located, you can reach the city center by 10/15 min Walk. I strongly recommend it!
10775488;68105687;2016-04-02;369386;Leah;We loved Ali's place! The apartment is beautiful and well appointed, and the location is perfect. Ali made it easy to check in and was attentive via text. We would definitely stay there again!
10775488;70152450;2016-04-16;8974669;Ekaterina;"We are very grateful to Ali, the apartment was wonderful!
Very good location, five minutes from the center. Near the house a supermarket and a great bakery. The apartment is very comfortable, bright and clean, well equipped and new. It was nice to stay here."
10775488;89783618;2016-07-30;1110592;Craig;Fantastic apartment! Ali was very welcoming, giving us lots of tips on where to eat, and his place was exactly as shown in pictures. It was also very clean and had everything needed for our stay in Amsterdam. In a great neighbourhood away from the centre but still 2 minutes from several restaurants, but easy to walk to the centre as well. The typical Amsterdam staircase was steep and narrow ans a bit tricky to navigate with luggage but other than that the flat is very new and modern. Can't say enough how much we enjoyed our stay here! Definitely our best AirBnB experience to date (and we've had some great ones).
10775488;108955019;2016-10-18;89876845;Wendy;Ali was a charming host from the moment we made an enquiry regarding staying in his apartment through to a smooth departure. His apartment is exactly as it is described and photographed. The apartment is located in a lovely area with very nice local eateries and bars and convenient shops. The tram is just outside. Ali is clearly very proud of his home and it was a pleasure to stay there.
10775488;124649373;2017-01-02;5350908;Jenny;"We stayed in Ali's place for three nights over New Year's Eve. He was very responsive to all of our questions, and flexible with check-in and check-out times. The apartment itself is very nice, modern, comfortable, and clean. The shower is great and the bed was very comfortable. The wifi was also super fast.

The location was great, too--it's not in the city center but it is very close to everything in the city. The neighborhood in which it is located is very hip, with lots of good restaurants. There is a grocery store on the ground floor of the building, which was convenient.

Overall, a great stay."

2557370;32815103;2015-05-22;17669745;Gaydit (Bee);The apartment was lovely, cozy and clean, just as described. Romy has put lots of personal touches that made the apartment feel like a home away from home. The bathtub is amazing.  I usually prefer taking showers but couldn't resist soaking in the bath especially after a long day of exploring the city. The neighborhood felt very safe and there is a nearby supermarket that made it easy to buy drinks, a few snacks and breakfast ingredients. Overall we enjoyed our stay so much that we wished we could have stayed longer.
2557370;36793199;2015-07-01;28860012;Marcia;O apartamento é ótimo, bem localizado, limpo e com todos os itens necessários para que o turista sinta-se em casa, detalhes como jogos americanos para a mesa foram surpreendentes, aspirador de pó e tábua para passar roupa também. Todas as louças e talheres estavam perfeitamente limpos, as toalhas de banho e roupa de cama muito bem lavadas. Local silencioso e vizinhança tranquila. Infelizmente não conhecemos a Romy, mas nossa estadia foi ótima. Recomendamos o apartamento a todos que queiram se sentir em casa em Amsterdam.
2557370;38503652;2015-07-16;27459804;Yassmon;We loved our time at romys place. The apartment looks just like the pictures. They have snacks and cold wine for you in the fridge . The bed is a nice huge bed queen size very comfortable also a little balcony off the bedroom . Nice size bathroom no shower curtain but this is not going to ruin your trip .this is great for couples as well oh one more great the they do have a cell phone for you to use on your trip there . This was our first air bnb stay we loved it wonderful place .
2557370;40901123;2015-08-03;26161741;Ahmet;Appartement was very clean and beautiful. I had a lovely stay during my visit amsterdam. Romy is a great host! She checked twice if i need anything, the view was wonderful and the beds were very comfy :). Near the house there is tram, it takes you a lot of places so dont worry if you think this house is isolated from city center.
2557370;41576678;2015-08-08;26392191;Sam;Romy was very friendly and welcoming, the apartment was even better than we expected, very spacious. The neighbourhood was great, a few cafes/shops/bars nearby and an easy tram or walk in to the central parts of Amsterdam
2557370;42679328;2015-08-15;34226475;Aileen;"We had a great time in Amstedam. Romy's apartment is beautiful - with everything we needed.  We loved the terrace where we had dinner a couple of nights. We walked to the city centre everyday. Great quiet neighborhood with restaurants, cafes and supermarket within a 5 min walk of the apartment.  Large park also a few mins away. 
We will definitely come back the next time we're in Amsterdam. 
Thank you Romy & Jesse!"
2557370;45818839;2015-09-06;3234214;Noelia;"When we come we are the really clean and tidy house. With sheets and clean towels
The house is as one sees in the photos unless it does not have the mosquito net that is on the bed. There are many mosquitos in the zone and in the night they were entering many mosquitos and they have punctured us.
It is possible to improve the utensils to cook since the frying pans and the casseroles stick. Nonetheless we have cooked well.
The neighborhood is very calm, there are no noises bad people do not meet.
It is connected well by the downtown.

2557370;51762801;2015-10-24;43857001;Flavien;The flat and the location Are perfect. Nice and cosy appartement With all the nécessary, maybe a microwave or oven could be add to the furniture. For the reste, it Was perfect.
2557370;57889016;2015-12-30;4992907;Sara;The apartment was great! The location was a bit out of the city center but it was super easy to get anywhere within the city using public transit.  Romy was very kind and even reached out to make sure I was having a good visit during my stay. Overall I'd recommend this airbnb for anyone planning a visit to amsterdam.
2557370;66903337;2016-03-25;2851627;Nina;"The stay was fantastic. Very very nice flat and Romy was very courteous. 
Gladly again"
2557370;83343187;2016-07-02;40486749;Maksim;The apartment is spacious, clean and quiet. The location is great, we really like that city district — not the city center but it's quite near and easy accessible by transport or 20 mins of walk. We had almost everything we need in the kitchen and in the bathroom (yeah, the sound system was powerfull and loud!) — the listing description of the room is accurate, everything is just like on the photos. Romy's apartment made our trip enjoyable and we would highly recommend it to anyone making a trip to Amsterdam.
2557370;86281855;2016-07-15;61216460;Robyn;A beautiful, clean place to stay. Just the right size for a city break and in the perfect location to both enjoy the laid-back residential areas, as well as hire bikes and cycle into the city centre. Fantastic polite and helpful hosts too, the travel information provided was the icing on the cake of our visit
2557370;110910775;2016-10-29;94934030;Kevin;Very nice apartment, bright and beautiful, just little lack of oven or microwave! Good Price and tips for the district , thanks you !
2557370;115632086;2016-11-26;40486749;Maksim;Well, it was the second time we visit Romy's place. And again it was very plesant stay! If you need a perfect place to stay in Amsterdam, to live like an Amsterdammer, to see and explore the city you should definitely choose B&B Westerpark.
8234253;65650166;2016-03-16;60777043;Aurélien;"Appartement très agréable, propre et lumineux. Bien équipé. La terrasse permet de profiter d'une belle vue sur les toits de la ville.
Bien situé, le centre d'Amsterdam est facilement accessible à pieds. Le quartier est vivant et vous y trouverez facilement bars, restaurants ainsi que supermarchés.
Sandra est une hôte très sympathique. 
Je recommande fortement cet appartement pour un séjour dans la capitale Hollandaise."
8234253;74558172;2016-05-15;13967196;Maura;We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Sandra's place in Amsterdam. We were greeted warmly by Sandra and her son (who helped my mom carry her luggage up the stairs). The apartment was tidy, well stocked with coffee and tea, and full of beautiful flowers! The rooftop was incredible and we had a lovely time sitting in the sun. Thanks Sandra!
8234253;76817809;2016-05-29;17551632;Sebastian;Sandra was one of the best hosts I've had. She was so much fun and made our stay in Amsterdam truly unforgettable. The apartment is beautiful and the rooftop terrace is unbeatable. Everything is a 15-20 minute walk and very convenient. We had a fantastic time exploring Amsterdam. Sandra met us at the apartment and was in constant contact with us. Would highly recommend to anyone staying in Amsterdam.
8024676;49579910;2015-10-04;20125178;Omar;"I was greeted with chocolate covered raisins, water with lime, and a city guide!

Bernard always replied in a timely manner, which made checking in/out painless.

 The apartment is comfortable, clean, and is in a nice location. I enjoyed my stay here and would stay here again."

8024676;68361662;2016-04-04;43032551;Youssef;Great apartment and the location was perfect, right opposite the Albert Cuyp market, and walking/tram distance to most landmarks. With plenty of breakfast and fast food options around for early mornings/late nights. The amenities were also great, including WiFi and Netflix! And the hosts were very welcoming and accommodating.
5957043;40050515;2015-07-27;37854910;Mincioaga;Great apartmen, big, clean, not far from public transport.
5957043;91882563;2016-08-07;67589770;Lone;"Neighbourhood was alright, though locals called it unsafe. Lots of rats outside when standing on the balcony.
Not properly cleaned, and missing kitchenware to have a meal for the amount of people that it was rented for.
Host send a friend for arrival/departure, he didn't show on the scheduled departure. (He had been drinking and was still sleeping when we called him).
A few good things, though: Sleeping facilities were fine, close to metro and grocery-shopping.
Would not recommend"
325416;37549729;2015-07-08;28673030;Marion;"The apartment was as expected, the location is as described. Good place. 
A detail: on the advert it's written 'private apartment' but actually a friend of the host has the keys and comes often during the day. Never mind.
I was put at the door overnight without reason at the beginning of July after 3 months whereas it remains me 2 months in Netherlands and I initially booked it until the end of August. Not a good idea for long-term."
16728262;132317024;2017-02-17;7729240;Vibe;I had a lovely stay in Tom's guesthouse in the middle of the city center and wish I could have stayed longer. It is very well located in walking distance to cafés, shops and the main museums, but at the same time peaceful and quiet for a good night's sleep in the comfortable bed. The balcony is overlooking a cosy backyard with a picturesque old church and the shower has all the equipment needed. I hope to be able to stay here again!
16728262;136704784;2017-03-12;102626048;Floris;"Great place to stay! We had the option to leave our luggage in the restaurant of the owner on the day we left :)
Small but nice and modern interior!"
568005;4416314;2013-05-04;5411204;Anna;"Yasha is very friendly and nice person. We had a really great week in Amsterdam. The apartment is very close to bus/tram stops. In our room we had absolutely everything that any tourist may need: a place to cook breakfast, make coffee; a fridge for food, utensils, a large wardrobe. We loved the terrace where we spent time when it was warm outside."
568005;4860923;2013-05-29;5868877;Geneviève;Accueil très sympathique.L'appartement est au dernier étage d'une jolie maison typique d'Amsterdam dans un quartier bourgeois,calme,des plus (URL HIDDEN) maison et l'appartement sont très bien entretenus.Après les visites des musées et de la ville on apprécie de trouver une literie très confortable...
568005;5581793;2013-07-07;6582987;Laura;a beautiful studio and friendly couple, great place to visit Amsterdam.
568005;13399182;2014-05-27;10266978;Leanne And Keith;We highly recommend Yasha and Dessi. We were provided with all the basic essentials for our stay. The room is on the top floor and very private. We were welcomed with a beautiful bottle of red wine. The outdoor roof top patio was amazing, we've spent the nights enjoying good wine and great Dutch cheese on the roof top soaking up the experience. The location is central and our very kind hosts gave us a list and map of cafe, shops and stores. Thank you Yasha and Dessi. It was a pleasure to stay in your beautiful home.
568005;28825832;2015-03-30;4377842;Elisa And Sam;Yasha and Dessi's flat was a dream come true, the perfect place to explore the best of Amsterdam. While we didn't get to interact much due to our long touristy days out, they provided great hospitality and even lent us a Museum card to get into museums for free ! Meeting Yasha's dad and talking literature on the sidewalk one morning was also a treat. We'll definitely be in touch if we come through Amsterdam again!
568005;30778080;2015-04-27;28904170;Julie;Es war super! Das Zimmer ist sehr schön, perfekt gelegen und mit dieser traumhaften Terasse... Dessi und Yasha sind supernett und sehr hilfsbereit. Es war wirklich sehr schön für uns. Wenn wieder Amsterdam, dann wieder bei den beiden!
568005;51438328;2015-10-20;41569719;Harriet;"Fantastic hosts and beautiful apartment in a great location.

My friend and I stayed with Yasha and Dessi as we were running the Amsterdam marathon and wanted somewhere comfortable where we could cook. The apartment was perfect;  lovely kitchen, coffee machine, teapot, plenty of storage, comfortable bed and a terrace! Yasha met us at the apartment and showed us around along with giving us a some chocolate, wine, a spare duvet and a travel adaptor, which was much appreciated. After the marathon, Dessi made sure that we were ok and offered to help us get food or anything else we needed as we were exhausted.  The apartment has everything you could possibly need, including guidebooks, and information on where is good to eat nearby.
Finally, the location is great. Less than 5 minute walk to the big 3 museums, so you can make the most of the any late night opening and nip along avoiding the big queues!"
568005;63109336;2016-02-20;83034;Di;I had such a great time in this trip -- my first visit to Amsterdam -- and no doubt it all started by the nice welcome I received from Yasha & Dessi. The studio delivers everything that it promises and it is in a perfect location, with most of the major attractions of the city a short walk away. Yasha was very attentive and responsive to all our questions and needs. They are great hosts and I'll certainly recommend this place to any friend planning a trip to Amsterdam.
568005;69846946;2016-04-14;3646976;Ben;"Yasha and Dessi most welcoming, even though we reached the home past 10 pm. 
The place was just as advertised; cozy, delightful. Minor things that were not working were addressed immediately.  
Very experienced as hosts and knew how to make us feel comfortable. 
Gave tips and helped us visit the Amsterdam's attractions in a very economical way. 
Well placed apartment - walking distance to the main museums, market and very convenient for taking the trams and buses. 
Easily the best Airbnb experience we had."
568005;75981036;2016-05-23;10232897;Magnhild;The bright loft studio is a hidden gem perfectly located in a local area of Amsterdam. My mom and I enjoyed our stay and had some good evenings spent on the private deck. We met Dessi and he was very friendly and accomedating. One thing to note is that when they say its a lot of stairs - it truly is. Dutch houses have high dealings so walking up four floors is a bit of a hike, but thats perhaps how they stay so fit :)
8482025;138504065;2017-03-20;45303633;Mixalis;Very nice house and hot....

This is a perfect place to stay few days/weeks."
12087517;81434475;2016-06-23;1946098;Joe;"The apartment is really nice, spacious, and clean. It's also very central to many great parts of Amsterdam. 

The hosts were excellent about coordinating the key exchange and giving us information about our stay. It should be noted that Raadhuisstraat is a busy road in Amsterdam, and it can be quite loud - nothing the hosts can do about it but it's the way it is, in case you are unfamiliar with the city. 

The beds are comfortable, the shower and bathrooms are great, and there is an espresso machine in the kitchen to get your morning started right. Albert Hein and a Marqt are not far away at all so you can get good groceries. The WiFi is also very high quality.

There are also rented rooms/hotels above this apartment, again another thing that the host cannot control unfortunately, but one night we had some tourists pounding up and down the stairs all night, which made it difficult to sleep.

On the whole, this is a great apartment with great hosts, but just be warned that it can be noisy."
12087517;88002003;2016-07-22;14924706;Alexander;"Nice stay in a beautiful loft almost in city center of Amsterdam.

Shirene was kind and she sent me a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) message with full of useful information about the city, including the name and location of a supermarket nearby.
7062137;58183113;2016-01-01;50308553;Matthieu;Premier séjour à Amsterdam, première expérience Airbnb et une agréable expérience.

The host was very responsive and helpful, and the apartment was clean and quiet with a nice balcony. The only feedback I have is that the bed was not made when we got there and we couldn't find the towels; also, the apartment looked somewhat different from the one in the photos and I'm not sure if that is due to renovations or if it was a different apartment. Otherwise, it was a nice and affordable place to stay to explore the city!"

Die Wohnung ist toll, sie ist mit liebe eingerichtet und man fühlt sich gleich wie daheim. Am Anfang war es zwar etwas kalt, doch nachdem wir das erste mal richtig durch geheizt hatten, war es immer angenehm warm. Die Tür zur Toilette lässt sich nicht richtig schließen, aber wir empfanden es als nicht so störend. Ganz besonders toll fanden wir den Erasmuspark direkt in der Nähe, hier konnten wir ogar unseren Hund frei laufen lassen, da er komplett umzäunt ist. Das Wetter war toll und sowohl wir als auch unser Hund haben die Spaziergänge dort genossen! Es war ein toller Aufenthalt bei Julia und ich würde sie Wohnung wieder buchen!

Друг Янива, передававший ключи, показал все что было нужно и рассказал куда стоит зайти, где взять велосипеды и все-все-все :)
Атмосфера жилья соответствует Амстердаму - можно расслабляться во дворике (полагаю, сауна тоже отличная, но мы ей не пользовались), можно медитировать в комнате или попробовать себя на одном из многочисленных инструментов! Прямо перед домом - аллея у реки, а на ближайшем перекрестке - аренда велосипедов и отличная кафешка Dubbel-op (аккуратней при заказе бургеров - вместо одного вам принесут два, да еще и с картошкой!), у остановки супермаркет Dirk van der Broek с самыми гуманными ценами в округе :)
Случайно получился инструктаж будущим жителям :)

5 minutes from railway station, big food shop 5 minutes walk. 
A big bed, big kitchen and small balcony where you can have a breakfast and lunch! It's really great! :)  
We really like Carolien's apartment. I very recommended this apartment to everyone who want to visit Amsterdam! Many thanks, Carolien! :)"
2370505;14271372;2014-06-16;4989789;Larisa;Carolien - excellent host. She waited for us in the apartment, all fully explained, demonstrated and always ready to help in any situation. We have to remember and what it many times to thank:) the Apartment is very convenient, in a quiet area, close to the railway station, 1 stop (5 minutes) drive from the centre. But very strongly recommend you to rent a bike to feel the whole atmosphere of this friendly city! Carolien knows what you need for a tired traveller and therefore the apartment has everything necessary. Bed just magic - heals from fatigue. Silence, morning coffee on the balcony, cosy courtyard...m-m-m...Want to come back again! It is a pity that not met with Mimi.
2370505;14606418;2014-06-23;14033930;Artur;"The apartment is great for its low price, well located near a train station in a quiet neighbourhood, not too far away from the city center.
The host was amazing, very friendly and helpful.
I would definitely return to this apartment a second time if I had the chance to visit Amsterdam again."
2370505;15399741;2014-07-08;14507189;Lana;"Carolien was very hospitable)) She was waiting us when we came. She left some beer, coffee and tea for us and explained where everything in the neighborhood was. The apartment was in excellent condition. I recommend staying with Carolien.

Каролин - гостеприимная хозяйка. Она была уже в квартире, когда мы приехали. В холодильнике нас ожидало пиво, а на полке чай и кофе. Квартира светлая, чистая, уютная. Мы провели там три дня. Рекомендую эту квартиру для аренды.

2370505;20951332;2014-10-08;8177367;Didem;Carolien was amazing host! She gave us nice advices and she was really helpful. Firstly, the house was exactly same as the pics. And then location was nice so close the public transportations and also you can go to the city center by walking. I'm so sorry that we couldn't spend much time with carolien i'm sure that she is also amusing :) Thanks again Carolien for everything! Looking forward to be back in Amsterdam!!
2370505;21703449;2014-10-22;20177197;Robin;"Carolien was a superb host. She met us at the flat and went out of her way to make sure we felt welcome. She gave us loads of ideas of things to do, and a great recommendation for a local restaurant. The apartment was amazing; close to public transport and a couple of shops for food/snacks. It was also very clean and well equipped. 

There's also a very good (and cheap) bike rental place very close to the apartment, and we would highly recommend hiring some as it's the quickest and most fun way to explore!

Would definitely stay at this apartment again, and would definitely recommend it to others."
2477880;121462079;2016-12-17;57647553;Helge;Fantastic flat in a perfect location. Jan is a very nice host with lots of local tips. The flat is very nice. We will stay there again.

1958574;35235145;2015-06-16;7686158;Scott;Magne and Marien were great hosts and provided me with a clean and well located place to stay. I had some delays getting into Amsterdam but they were easy to communicate with and made sure there was someone there to greet me and give me a quick run down. Had a great time in Amsterdam and I loved staying just a stones throw away from everything without having to be in the middle of it. Every morning I had my breakfast watching bee's fly around all the flowers in the small garden, and it definitely was a great touch to my relaxing trip away. I know if I come back I'll be hoping to stay here again!
1958574;57337734;2015-12-24;3513896;Allison;"Magne is an excellent host. She was easy to get in touch with and she helped me with everything I needed. She provided me with great advice about where to go for food, arts etc as well.
This good sized (ground floor) studio apartment is in a convenient location, a short ferry ride from central station. The ferries are very frequent. When I first arrived, I was met at the ferry and shown to the apartment (very close by).  It's by a newly trendy area.
The apartment has tall wide windows and is adjacent to a playing field."
1958574;60085406;2016-01-18;50258992;Elliott;Just lovely!!!
1958574;68419244;2016-04-04;60096346;Mario;Magne was truly a gracious and attentive host. I could not have asked for a better Airbnb experience!
1958574;74174801;2016-05-13;9548844;Javier;"Magne's studio is exactly as seen in the pictures and it has all you need to spend a few days in Amsterdam. You need to take the ferry from Central Station to Ijplein to get there, but it's just 5 minutes (and for free), so even if the area is very very quiet you are no more than 10 minutes away from the city centre.  

If you want to stay up until late maybe location is not great as the ferry finishes at midnight, but for me this was not a problem, and you can always take an alternative ferry (and walk a bit longer) during the whole night."
12804908;86052983;2016-07-14;69876169;Avery;We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam. The room was large, bright, and clean. The location was excellent for walking everywhere we wanted to go including museums and restaurants. We would stay here again :)
15433270;122123480;2016-12-21;27133168;Sean;Nice and friendly host. Very easy to communicate with. The apartment is very simple, basic, and well-maintained, suitable for those who just need a place to sleep at night. Overall good value.
49790;262698;2011-05-14;440143;Martha;"Klaas is basically a lesson in ""How to be an amazing AirBnB host.""  Every details was considered and I had the best stay in Amsterdam!  The house boat was clean, beautiful and in perfect shape.  The information sheet Klaas listed had information about how to work everything in the house, and he also had wine and beer available for purchase, which was a great touch.

Klaas explained to me how to get to my conference venue, showed me how to work the doors, wifi, television, etc. and was just overall a very very nice host.  The next time I return to Amsterdam, I hope to stay in Klaas' houseboat again.  It was a relaxing and fun place to stay and I highly recommend it!"
49790;324250;2011-06-20;541357;Tim;"Klaas was the perfect host. His communication before I arrived was great and he gave specific directions to his boat which was appreciated.
The houseboat itself was immaculate and perfect for a base in Amsterdam.
Klaas provided a great coffee machine and wine and beer in the fridge for sale (at reasonable prices) Just in case you don't feel like going out to the shops to buy your own.
Shops, cafes are close as well as the tram straight into the centre and nearby the beautiful Vondel Park to walk through.
I would definitely recommend staying here.
We had a great time and stayed in a great place.
Thanks Klaas
Next trip to Amsterdam this boat will be my first choice."
49790;423758;2011-08-06;466881;Al;"I booked this as a honeymoon for my friend, I asked him to write the review...

What can we say? Well… If you want to arrive in Amsterdam and instantly believe that you live there, then this is the place for you. We were met by Ivelina; she told us how everything worked and then she left us to it. All of a sudden, we lived on a beautiful house boat in the museum district of Amsterdam. Not too far from anything at all, a short tram ride or even walk to the culture centre and just as close in the other direction to all the red lights. All in all, it was an absolutely amazing experience held in the greatest of comfort and the most pleasant of environments. It is a very highly recommended place to stay.
 
Much love

49790;1077667;2012-04-03;1349507;Julia;We had a lovely stay on Klaas' houseboat.  He met us promptly at the arranged time, showed us how all his gadgets worked, and left us for three days to enjoy!  The houseboat is very nicely furnished, with a very comfortable bed, for a great night sleep.  We rented bikes from him for 28 Euros for three days.  Couldn't be easier!  We felt very at home, and enjoyed our stay.  Very easy walk to the tram, and several great restaurants.  We enjoyed the deck, and watching the boats pass on the canal.  I would stay here again, without reservation.
49790;1199773;2012-04-30;1735482;Diane;"We stayed in Klass house boat in April 2012 to celebrate outr 10th wedding anniversary. 
Our stay was even better than we could have imagined! 
The house boat is fabulous....every facility that you could need. Very clean, modern and extremely comfortable.
It is located in a very peaceful neighborhood only a 10 min walk from a frequently run tramline.
We were met by a friend of Klass who was very helpful and friendly...offering us good tips and advice.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it.
 A great experience in a great city!"
49790;2459158;2012-09-30;205736;Tod;Amazing place.  Incredible host.  Best Airbnb stay ever.  I plan to return.
49790;4245296;2013-04-22;5121415;Lynn;Fantastic houseboat with all amenities you could ask for - Klaas is extremely helpful and very welcoming to his boat. The location is close to markets, shops and the tram, and quiet for those who like to be in the less busy sections of Amsterdam. Would stay here again without hesitation. He also has a nice selection of wines for purchase and even provides coffee for the morning - how great is that?!
49790;19851569;2014-09-19;9252089;Yanette;After 4 Airbnb host-cancellations while travelling in Europe, we were so happy to be able to secure our replacement accommodation at such short notice, only two days before moving in. We were met by David, filling in for Klaas, as we arrived early. The houseboat was EXACTLY like the photos, everything one could wish for, was provided. There was even a mini bar with wine and beer and a cupboard full of music DVDs/CDs. We did not use the TV though, too much to see and do in Amsterdam. The bed was extremely comfortable, there were blinds over the windows to block out the street lights, so a good sleep was guaranteed. The communication with Klaas before and during our stay, was amazing, him replying immediately. We spent most of our evenings relaxing on the deck at the back of the boat watching the world go by. The houseboat is close to two amazing parks, Vondel Park with restaurants and Rembrandt Park. Various tram stops were only a 5 to 10-minute walk away, taking you anywhere in Amsterdam. The AH supermarket was close by in case you want to do your own cooking, but cafés and other eateries are all within walking distance. A perfect place to stay, close to the Museum Quarter and the Pijp area. We loved Klaas' houseboat. Highly recommended. Thanks, Klaas, for being such a great host!
49790;37593648;2015-07-08;35716811;Allen;Working with Klaas to make our reservation and arrival at the houseboat was flawless.  The unit is exactly as described in the listing and photographs.  The parade of passing boats presents terrific entertainment but stops early enough in the evening to afford a quite nights sleep.  We loved the adjacent neighborhood and local restaurants.  We had traveled to Amsterdam many times before and we felt more like a local than a tourist even though you are only a beautiful walk though the park to museum area.  The kitchen is very well equipped although we used it primarily to make coffee in the mornings.  There is no freezer and as Americans we love our ice especially for an evening cocktail on the back deck.  However, it is only a short walk to the local Albert Hinz where a bag of ice is just 72 cents.  We were there in July during some of the warmest weather of the season and with the fan in the bedroom and the natural cooling at night the lack of air-conditioning  was not a problem.
49790;50167785;2015-10-10;38828987;Traci;"I stayed at Klaas' houseboat Oct. 3-10. It was amazing! Klaas was very helpful with any questions I had, hints about the city and making arrangements for extra activities.

The houseboat is in a very nice residential area, not too many tourists, but centrally located by bike, walking or taxi to any destination. Sitting on the patio of the houseboat, sipping champagne and watching the boats go by is absolutely magnificent. 

Amsterdam is a wonderful city, very easy to maneuver, the locals are very friendly and helpful.

I highly recommend a visit to Amsterdam and a stay in Klaas' houseboat!"

The room we stayed in was on the third floor, and was a little segregated from the rest of the house. We enjoyed having our own space, and they all made us feel welcome. The apartment was about 30 minutes from the city center by metro, with about a 10 minute walk to the metro station. We enjoyed being on the outskirts of the city, and the neighborhood seemed to mostly be young families. Would recommend!
5475024;60694520;2016-01-26;24859859;Ruqi;Sorry for arriving late. The room is comfortable and convenient, and close to the metro station and supermarket. The surrounding environment is excellent. Besides, Jasmijn is friendly to us and helped us a lot.

Their flat is in a great location just outside the centre - about a 15 minute walk. The bedroom, living area and kitchen were perfect for a long weekend trip, very comfortable and homely with everything you need including a TV and cooking equipment. 

Would definitely recommend staying in their flat and would also stay there again if I were to go back to Amsterdam. 

Thanks for a great holiday!

Comfortable bed, a generous supply of food and amenities and it was super tidy. I loved exploring the area De Pijp and it's many trendy bars and cafes all within walking distance. We used all of Bart's tips and recommendations in where to visit and eat which i appreciated as i was short on time to research Amsterdam. Bart was responsive with all questions and request and was flexible with our late arrival and delay. I loved it and can't wait to go back.

The house has everything you need, so your stay will surely be a comfortable one, as was ours. Unfortunately, we didn't meet with our host, but there was some welcome drinks waiting.

I recommend using bikes to get to the city centre and also while in it, especially if there is no rain. It takes around 10 minutes to the ferry and then around 5 more to the centre.

I surely recommend this house, especially for families."

I told the hosting company that we would be there at 8 they said phone half an hour before which I did at 745 told them I would be 30 minutes. Got there at 815 only to wait in the rain and snow outside until 835. Lots of personal items left around but nothing useful. Broken tap in the kitchen. No waste bins anywhere? No TV. No sitting room, just 2 bedrooms. Asked to take bedding off of the bed before we left. All very strange really considering.

The location is great, with just 10min to the central station and city centre (you have to take ferry to cross the river). First day they picked us up and showed us everything on the boat. They filled the water tank, there is even a small boat by side and they offered to show us the city with it, but unfortunatelly we had no time. Despite no plugs, there are lights and also a small portable gas cooker. They´ve also inserted a chemical toilet. So to sum up, the hosts are very friendly and helpful and the boat is great option for young people seeking tons of fun in the city of Amsterdam!

953041;4688676;2013-05-20;4423862;Volha;"Mu husband and I had a nice stay on Joyce's boat celebrating my husband's birthday. We had stayed on boats twice before and would never consider staying in a hotel instead. The location of the boat is great, very central and therefore close to many attractions and good places to eat. The boat itself is not big, but easily accommodates 1-2 people, is cozy and is as described (there is a bit of lack of storage space, however; also, the boat  has a bit of a slope, which takes some adjusting to, but it did not bother us that much; finally, as the canal is rather narrow and very busy during the day, expect tourist boats passing very close by; again, that did not bother us, and we quite enjoyed waiving at other tourists pretending to be local, and the outside terrace was great for having a drink/feeding ducks and coots!). Joyce was a great hostess, very prompt in responding and helpful offering advice (also, when on the first night we were disturbed by a noisy party in a house next door, we let her know and she was quick to assure us that it was not common, gave us instructions in case it happened again and offered further assistance; indeed, the second night was very peaceful). Joyce also decorated the boat with fresh flowers and supplied a welcome pack of beer, wine and fruit, which was much appreciated. We would recommend the place and would consider staying again."

953041;24721671;2015-01-02;11834913;Magali;Perfect location!!! We had a wonderful Time in the boat! Thank you very much Joyce :-)
953041;50456949;2015-10-12;6308677;Chris;Incredible place in a great location. Joyce was very helpful and we had a lovely time. Definitely recommend the barrel boat!
953041;80834612;2016-06-20;6450651;Alan;Joyce made us feel very welcome indeed. The houseboat is in the best area and is the only place to stay in Amsterdam! Do it! you won't regret it.

La casa es muy bonita, moderna, y el sofá es muy confortable. Me sentí como en mi propia casa. El barrio donde vive es muy céntrico y con todo lo necesario a menos de 40 metros (tranvía, panadería, canal...)
Muchas Gracias Carlos, hasta pronto!"
5613210;47688500;2015-09-21;39895815;Siobhan;What a fabulous time we had!  David and Phoebe's studio couldn't have been more beautiful - the location, the view, and the studio itself were just lovely.  David & Phoebe made us feel really welcome, and it really felt as if it was our own home.  The space was airy and comfortable with lots of space.  We can't wait to go back!  Highly recommend!
5613210;48568332;2015-09-27;5226347;Alexander;"David and Phoebe are wonderful hosts and they were extremely helpful from beginning to end. They offered to make dinner reservations and left us with volumes of info on Amsterdam. But beyond the kindness and assistance was a marvellous apartment adorned with David's artwork. It's perfectly located in Jordaan, very close to loads of great restaurants and cafes. I hope to return here on my next trip!

I highly recommend this flat, perfect for one or two people."
5613210;49551696;2015-10-04;2310797;Steve;awesome and inspiring place. quiet but central. perfect spot for enjoying Amsterdam for a weekend. Thanks David!
1232131;7082476;2013-09-05;7715842;Andre;Thanks to Omyra. She has a wonderful apartment. Very helpful and friendly Person. Always smiling :). I had the hole apartment for me, that was great. Everything was clean. Large apartment with a 	balcony and a very good equipped kitchen. I absolute recommend her.
1232131;7206518;2013-09-10;8417679;Max;"Everthing was fine. I used this comfy appartment for 4 days and was lucky to be the only guest. So I had - besides the toilet and bathroom of course -  a huge living-kitchen-room (with balcony) to use and Omyra was so nice to let me choose the room: Either the one bed-room or the three-bed-room (with one bunk-bed and one single bed). So I choosed the bed with the best mattress.
If you checked the tram and busses its a great and quiet place to come home to - from a long day in the city. And it really takes you not too long to the city.
I liked it very much. Thanx to Oymra and her family!"

Thanks Omyra, hope to stay more!"

Omyra's husband gave me a hearty welcome. I met Omyra some days later and we have a nice chat. The accommodation is really in a perfect state, the location is ""strategic"" for reaching both the City Center and Schiphol. Highly recommendable."
1232131;54299050;2015-11-17;33957207;Dario;Great place, had the apartment to myself so it was a nice relaxing experience. Very easy access to the center and a supermarket right across the road. A+

Jolanda und ihr Mann waren sehr nett und immer gut zu erreichen, außerdem waren sie sehr flexibel bei unserer Ankuftszeit.

Die Wohnung ist etwas südlich vom Zentrum in einer ruhigen Straße, aber sehr nah am Van Gogh Museum und dem Museumsplatz gelegen. Fahrradverleih ca. 10 min zu Fuß.

Ich kann Jolandas Unterkunft nur wärmstens empfehlen, sie ist perfekt für ein Amsterdam-Wochenende geeignet!"

There is everything you need in her beautiful equipped home. The place is perfekt located, close to shops and the tram station in a nice and not touristic neighborhood, so that you can catch the feeling of being a local.
The only disadvantage was to have no more time to stay there longer. :-)"

10996068;62202735;2016-02-12;50621420;Hayley;We loved staying in this apartment. Located in a very cool area where you can get a feel of how locals live. Gorgeous, quirky little cafes with fantastic food and coffee, Razmataz cafe around the corner was a highlight, offering an extensive list of gin's. It's not too much of a distance if you want to go into red light district but we had done it all before and we enjoyed this side of amsterdam much much more! The apartment was large and furnished beautifully, somewhere I'd love to call home. Thanks so much we will be back!
10996068;67011690;2016-03-26;25821701;Kar Yan;Great apartment in a quite neighborhood, just a few minutes from public transport. Lots of food and restaurant close by. I'd love to stay there again.
10996068;90396131;2016-08-01;3742604;Erik;Hev's apartment is a very spacious one bedroom with tasteful vintage decor located a few minutes' walk outside the main canal zones of central Amsterdam.  It's situated on a secluded side street off a neighborhood full of restaurants and shops, which is bustling during the day and quiets down at night.  (Not much is open late in the immediate environs - you'll have to go further downtown for bars and clubs.)  I walked everywhere during my stay here, and felt spoiled for options within a 20-minute radius of the apartment.  Hev gave clear instructions that made checking in totally painless.  A couple catches - the apartment is mostly lit with natural light through the huge windows, but since Amsterdam is so cloudy it's often not nearly as bright as the photos.  Also, the bathroom is TINY, to the point that I could barely use the toilet with the door closed!  Other than those niggles I had a great experience, and overall I really enjoyed staying here during my visit to Amsterdam.
10996068;98077392;2016-08-29;28942983;Christina;Lovely spacious apartment, great location right between both centraal station and the museum. The only let down is that you can hear people above walking around upstairs quite clearly. Cleaner comes in straight on 11am at check out, so be prepared to leave ASAP. The photos are an accurate show of what the apartment is like.
10996068;103257350;2016-09-21;87121957;Ilana;Great apartment, great location! The space itself was really nice, clean, and had everything we needed for our 3 day stay in Amsterdam. Perfect for two people. The neighborhood was also really cute, with restaurants and shops nearby, and a fairly close walk to the 'center' of the city. The host was very responsive to our questions via email. Overall a great stay and would definitely recommend again!
10996068;104250995;2016-09-25;49299484;Ramiro;Beautiful apartment, in a quiet zone and really near from the beautiful canals. The apartment is huge and has everything you need to spend some great days! Thanks Hev and Elza!

She has a beautiful, spacious, bright room in an area that is walking distance to where it all happens. She provided me with a box of maps and informations (including a walking tour) of Amsterdam which was very very handy. I really loved staying in her apartment and would recommend it to anyone!!! Thank you Lotte for your hospitality!!!

Jan Jaap is a nice host and the locationis great! 
Good shops around the corner,close to the city and the highway.
The  kitchen is very convenenient and o.k., but the furniture needs some maintenance. I brought some personal decoration and extra fittings tomake the space more cosy and had a great time!"

Wir waren gern hier und waren super von der Lage, der Stadt und dem Boot begeístert."

I really loved my time there. Thanks a lot Ilana!!!"
15038670;123405329;2016-12-29;58242064;Gabriela;Ilana was a great host! She was always available to help and the flat is very confortable. It is not big, but enough when your goal is to visit the city. The flat is very near to public transport and the city center is reachable by tram in 15-20! Ilana, thanks for everything :)

1583266;18958303;2014-09-03;15280306;Molly;Murat and Ela were two of the most generous, open, kind, warm hosts I've ever met! I only wish I could have spent more time with them. Their home is beautiful and clean with a very comfortable bed and atmosphere. Having coffee and a fridge in the room was so wonderful and their neighborhood is lively and beautiful with an amazing market everyday right at the end of their street. I even borrowed their bicycle and had an even better adventure in Amsterdam thanks to that. I cannot recommend this sweet beautiful people and their wonderful home enough. Thank you Murat and Ela!!
1583266;19437393;2014-09-12;16683382;Adam;Great location, easy going hosts, clean room. Sepearated rooms which made sure there was enough privacy for all. Would stay again - thanks

We didn't even want to leave this place, because we felt so welcomed. The rooms looked amazing, everything was clean. With a bike, its around 5-10 minutes to a metro station, which is very cool. 
So it was great, I definitely recommend this place."
13049056;96201319;2016-08-22;43852363;Lydivine;Notre séjour chez Mariah a été super. Regil nous a très bien accueilli. La chambre est bien plus spacieuse qu'on ne le croit au travers des photos avec un balcon privé très agréable en matinée. La chambre est sécurisée : nous en avons les clés et nous avons vraiment pu nous sentir comme chez nous! De plus. La maison est très bien située: proche de la gare, magasins à proximité, dans un quartier calme, devant un lac très mignon. Mariah a été très arrangeante, surtout lors de notre départ. Au plaisir d'y retourner un de ces quatre.
4646450;26446412;2015-02-13;24330792;Amanda;The apartment was in a great location - very close to public transit and also within walking distance to the city center. The apartment was nice and spacious, however the bathroom wasn't as described in the listing. The shower was in the bedroom and the bedroom door is glass so the apartment lacked privacy. Other than that, the apartment was great and had everything we needed.

Aya was extremely helpful with advice about getting to the apartment and around the city. She also gave great recommendations on what to do whilst we were there. 

We'd highly recommend the apartment. 

Thanks again Aya.

2067245;18944003;2014-09-03;17728338;Sabine;We stayed in the summerhouse (I absolutely felt in love with) with our two kids (2 and 5 years old) and it was perfect for our five day trip in and around Copenhagen. The kids could play in the beautiful garden and pick apples from the trees. The house is in quiet and lovely quarter of Copenhagen, but also very close to the city center. Gerd is a great landlord. He helped us with everything. Just knock on his door!
2067245;20577703;2014-10-01;21393809;Doris;Ausgesprochen nette und hilfreiche Gastgeber. Die Beschreibung war genau, ein wunderschönes Häuschen in einem zauberhaften Garten. Alles bestens.
2067245;28408652;2015-03-23;1469551;Angelo;"The best Airbnb so far! Fabulous house: just as beautiful as the photos. Great location, beautiful part of the city! Nice bikes and great tour to the city center. Last but not least: Gert was a great host! When we arrived he made the house cosy (he put on the lights, candles and heating) and gave us a warm welcome! (Is it weird we already miss him ;)). We will be back for sure!"
2067245;34645480;2015-06-10;13535487;Kirsten;Thanks to Gert and his daughter we had a very pleasant city trip to CPH. We slept over in their cosy gardenhouse. It is small but everything you need is in there and the scandinavian interior looks amazing. We rented 2 bikes wich was a very nice way to discover the city. Gert and Clara were perfect host, and we would love to come back one time.
2067245;35394945;2015-06-18;1409764;Jamie & Nik;"Our stay at Gert's garden cottage was fantastic. Gert met us on the first day and gave us lots of tips for riding bikes in the city, and was always around if we needed help. The cottage was exactly as I had hoped it would be...quaint and smartly designed with views of the host's lush garden from every window.

As shown in the photo, the sleeping loft is pretty low. We are 5'-6"" and 5'-10"" and didn't have any trouble.

We would definitely stay here again."

Wir haben uns von der ersten Sekunde an wirklich super wohl gefühlt. Das hübsche, helle Gartenhäuschen  liegt sehr ruhig mitten im Garten, umgeben von Obstbäumen, in einer wirklich schönen Siedlung von Kopenhagen, die etwas außerhalb des Zentrums liegt. Da es uns auf dem Fahrrad zu frisch war, sind wir immer mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gefahren. Die Unterkunft liegt genau zwischen zwei S-Bahn-Haltestellen und man ist im Grunde in ca. 10 Minuten in der Innenstadt. Wir kommen bestimmt wieder!
2067245;129788748;2017-02-02;70999126;Tom;A lovely cosy cottage in a quiet residential area yet within such a quick train ride to the main centre of Copenhagen. Felt very homely and comfortable. Had a great stay!
2067245;134598357;2017-02-28;68625728;Charlotte;Gert's place is a cost nest, in a lovely garden. The neighbourhood is very relaxed and green, but very accessile to the city center by train. Be ready to climb the ladder to get to bed (in a cosy chamber which we loved). Gert and Rocio were very helpful in guiding and welcoming us. I definitely recommend the place.
2067245;140628834;2017-03-31;65090494;Jacqueline;We couldn't have asked for a better place to call home during our 9 day stay in Copenhagen. The garden house was warm, and cozy. Absolutely perfect to come back to after a long day of exploring. The train was easily accessible, and the bikes were a great way to experience the city! Gert and Charlotte were the perfect hosts. I misplaced my carry on bag with my passport/laptop/medication in it on my first day. Charlotte took me to a pharmacy to find medication, contacted metro service for me, and provided us with a charger, a camera, and some much needed reassurance. (And carrot cake!) Gert was ever positive and optimistic that my bag would be returned, and it was! Honestly a wonderful experience from start to finish. We couldn't recommend the garden house more, and should we return to Copenhagen we'd absolutely want to stay again!
2067245;144984677;2017-04-17;36551829;Rachel;Lovely quaint summer house set in a residential area. Very peaceful with a lovely garden. Perfect to relax after a days sightseeing.

The sleeping loft is reaced by a ladder so you may wish to consider that is you have mobility issues."

The flat is really close to city center and we walked everywhere. I only used metro from airport to home and for return. We stayed for xmas and we were so lucky that we could easily find shops and markets. Therefore, we really feel like our home.  
The design of the house is nice and cosy!

The area of the appartment is quiet and we slept very well.
If I go back to Copenhague I'm pretty sur that I'll go back on his appartment !"
12148640;156331926;2017-05-30;66778675;Dan;"Bjarke's apartment was a perfect spot for two travelers staying in Copenhagen. Just about a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro station that will have you in the heart of the city within another 10 minutes. The neighborhood is very quiet and secluded from some of the busier nightlife and attractions the city has, but is situated close to a bike rental which is a perfect way to get around, as well as a grocery store to save a few dollars from eating out at restaurant everyday! Communication was Bjarke was great and he detailed everything about the residence when we arrived. It was well equipped, albeit the very small shower/bathroom, but that was fine; and it was very much affordable given the high prices of the city-center locations. I would happily recommend Bjarke's apartment to others traveling here in the future."
12148640;157898293;2017-06-05;91856606;Caroline;"Good stay at Bjarke' s appt.  Previous comments tell it all. Location is quiet but close to métro with 10' access to either city center or airport. Playground for kids is great and you can see it from the appt. Bjarke was not in town but replied quickly to inquiries. Tak ! I guess the only thing that I didn't enjoy much was the bathroom /WC ; pipes were leaking. But it was a good laugh and a fun time with the kids."

He sent lots of information in advance to make it easy to find his place. on arrival we had lovely printed tips on copenhagen and wine, cheese and chocolate..lovely! 

the apartment is gorgeous with everything you need including music, books and cooking. very clean and pretty. location is perfect for coffee shops, the best bakery (brod) where you must try the cinnamon rolls, good restaurants and bars. also good brunch places too. easy 25 min walk to city or bus straight in. 

would definitely recommend! thanks Henrik!

The appartment has a very warm feel to it, we definitely recommend staying there if you plan to visit beautifull Copenhagen!
5824541;31335854;2015-05-04;20368223;Lina;"I can highly recommend Nina as your host and her apartment as your place to stay. Nina was very nice, friendly and helpful, easy to communicate with and quick to answer. The apartment is beautiful! It lies on the top floor (no elevator) it is large, airy, high ceilings and plenty of windows gives a beautiful light in the apartment. The only thing that is small is the bathroom (typical for apartments in Copenhagen). It is the perfect apartment for a couple who wants to have a romantic weekend in Copenhagen! Less suited for a family due to many stairs without elevator and small bathroom. 

If you choose Nina as your host and her apartment for your stay, I am sure you will be happy with your choice. Enjoy!"
5824541;48594265;2015-09-27;12230702;Pauline;We had a great time in Copenhagen. Nina's appartment is in a fine neigbourhoud and verry central (only metro from airport and 5 minutes walk and nearby citty). Good atmosphere and warm welcome. Nina was verry  flexibele about arriving time and leaving yime. Forth floor no problem, highly recommandable, I'll will book again when we go back tot Copenhagen!
14726786;105255469;2016-10-01;42253315;Doris;Extremely convenient spot right next to the metro station. Pillips is a great host and let me check in earlier than I expected. The house is really clean and well maintained.
14726786;124581970;2017-01-02;93391123;Cailin;"Literally what you see is what you get. A spacious, modern apartment in a great location. Phillip was more than accommodating making sure I had no issues checking in, providing local advice and allowing me time in the apartment to relax on my own accord. 

I highly recommend the stay. You can't get any better."
14726786;126921173;2017-01-15;10369154;Marjo;Thank you so much Phillip for this great experience. The flat was like in the pictures and I loved it! Phillip was great, open minded and curious. He was very flexible with check in and check out which was much appreciated considering my flight was late! The location is ideal. I would highly recommend to anyone this place!
14726786;127526973;2017-01-19;10474562;Nathaniel;This was my first visit to Copenhagen and I'm so glad I found Phillip's listing. It is a well designed home, for those who enjoy culture and design you will appreciate the tasteful way Phillip has decorated. It's in the center of the city, three blocks from the Nørreport station so travel to and from the airport is very easy. It's right by an area that has many food cart and drink options. I would highly recommend this Airbnb, Phillip is a wonderful host.
14726786;132013578;2017-02-15;2214799;Dmitry;If you want to experience the famous Danish 'hygge' then Philip's place is definitely for you. It is one of the most inspirational places I've ever stayed at, The flat is really well-located - I managed to see all major landmarks just walking. I saw Philip very briefly, but he was very friendly and helpful. Recommend this listing a lot!
14726786;151473476;2017-05-13;118406487;Amber;Phillip was very kind and accommodating , super cute apartment in a great location highly recommend!
14726786;155295016;2017-05-28;34241685;Puay Leng;I feel so lucky to have found Phillip's place on airbnb. Superb location - few minutes away from Norreport metro - which is just abt 20plus mins of train ride to or from airport. The flat is nicely decorated, just like what you see in the photos. And Phillip is very accommodating with my early check-in and late check-out. Oh! And the bed was very comfortable. Strongly recommend!
900050;73257635;2016-05-07;7906127;Victoria;"The apartment was spacious and decorated with taste with a brand new kitchen and bathroom. it was also very clean.
We felt just like at home.
The neighborhood is nice and quite with some cafés and parks just round the corner.
Kate was very helpful and responsive to all our questions."
900050;78216705;2016-06-05;2032143;Anneli;Die Wohnung ist sehr schön und super gelegen. Kate ist eine nette Gastgeberin und hatte einige nützliche Tipps für mich. Ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt und würde die Wohnung definitiv weiterempfehlen.
1590470;18497221;2014-08-27;6172138;Laurent;Ivan place was perfect to stay. Ivan was very easy for the checkin and checkout. Very quiet place
1590470;34427222;2015-06-08;28178573;Barbara;Perfekte Lage in der Nähe des Bahnhofs, Grünruhelage, allerdings trampeln die Bewohner der darüberliegenden Wohnung in der Früh recht laut (Ohropax empfehlenswert, wenn man sensibel ist). Ivan hat sehr rasch reagiert, auch early check-in war kein Problem. Perfekte Größe für 2 Personen, auch ein für dänische Verhältnisse sehr geräumiges Bad.
1590470;108731380;2016-10-17;93428478;Mark;"Spent a great few days at Ivan’s place in Vesterbro with my girlfriend. Perfect location to crash for a long weekend with a wall full of films (the apartment looks exactly like the pics - v clean, comfy bed and the decor is amazing), great sound system and kitchen - all within walking distance of everything in central Copenhagen (we were recommended to rent bikes @ Baisikeli but never bothered as everything easily walkable).

Great area at night with bars / places to eat and meat packing district only a 5min walk away. Many reviews commenting on safety of the area but we found very similar to ‘trendy’ areas elsewhere (e.g. East London) with the flat being in a gated community an added layer of safety.

Ivan was extremely helpful throughout - from admin pre-trip, to allowing us late check-in around 2230 to being available on message if ever we needed anything. Couldn’t recommend highly enough. We didn’t see nearly enough of Copenhagen, but when back for a bit more will definitely stay here again."
1590470;110072991;2016-10-24;19157496;Emily;Ivan wasa great host: very welcoming and friendly and gave us recommendations for places to visit in the city and good restaurants in the area.
1590470;152168409;2017-05-15;34057040;René;"I stayed in Ivans apartment for a long weekend with good friends in Copenhagen. The apartment was very central, especially since you can exit to several different streets directly from the backyard.
The interior was interesting and very hip, I liked it alot. The shower was larger than most I've seen in Copenhagen, and the sofa was nice for some rest after or during a busy day in the pulsating neighborhood of Vesterbro.
The bedroom was large and tidy, with room for luggage and windows that are safe to open for some extra air during the warmest days and nights.
I recommend staying at Ivans place for a nice place to live while enjoying the great neighborhood of Vesterbro."
2623900;17615498;2014-08-15;11791393;James;Wonderful upstairs apartment, perfect location in Fredricksburg, Copenhagen, 1 block from Metro, shopping and parks. We were there for 7 weeks - great time!
2623900;44192877;2015-08-24;22314224;Pauline;"The apartment is very central. 
Everything was well organized for the arrival and departure.
The apartment is perfect for a single person or a couple.
Thanks Felix for letting us your place."
2623900;56836313;2015-12-19;33302263;Annika;I had a 4 month stay at the apartment. It is located very central. The area is great, with lots of cafés, restaurants and shops. The metro station is near by. Felix was very helpful and answered all questions right away. I would definitely recommend a stay at Felix´s apartment.
13775120;93145078;2016-08-11;1936118;James;This apartment is a wonderfully stylish, located is a cool area close to great bars, cafes, restaurants and public transport.  Easy walking distance to central station and Tivoli gardens. The owner Inge is a lovely lady who was really helpful check in and check out and gave us some really good insider tips to what was happening in Copenhagen during our stay.  Highly recommend this homely apartment.
13775120;151758809;2017-05-14;9106149;David;"Inge was a terrific host.  Her communication was excellent, and she went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable.  She had a neighbor check me in and find extra supplies.  She even held my bags after checkout so I could explore Copenhagen!

Her place is welcoming and comfortable.  It's close to transit and parks.  I would definitely stay here again.  Thank you Inge!"
5565882;34655091;2015-06-10;31891910;Katrien;"I very much enjoyed our stay at Rune's apartment and I highly recommend it! 

The location is excellent. There are plenty of cosy coffee shops, bars and good restaurants in the neighbourhood. It is also very close to the central station and easily connected to the airport. The apartment is also walking distance away from the other cool areas of Copenhagen.

The apartment itself is also very nice. The kitchen is very well-equipped and the living room is cosy. The apartment is rather small, but it is very well organised and can easily fit 4 people.

Rune was very welcoming! We arrived in the middle of the night, but was still available for help in case we had trouble getting into the apartment. He also provided us with a booklet with all the necessary information for using all the utilities.

I would for sure recommend this apartment and would use it again in case I return to Copenhagen!"
6418220;78593286;2016-06-07;50018088;Geoffrey;Ida's flat worked perfect for 2 people for our trip to Copenhagen. The pictures were accurate and the place was very clean upon arrival. Ida was very friendly and helpful. We rented bikes (highly recommend) and had no problem reaching any tourist destination in the city. Would definitely recommend to 1 or 2 people touring the city.
9964840;64873711;2016-03-08;29864655;Yola;Signe and Rasmus' apartment is very well decorated, very clean and we loved it! The location is perfect! Communicating with Signe and Rasmus was very easy and they were very kind. They also left some sweets and some instructions and tips for Copenhagen. Next time we hope be able to stay a bit longer and in case we visit Copenhagen again we will definitely contact you again. Thank you so much Signe and Rasmus for your hospitality.
7068872;103542396;2016-09-23;18357411;Sarah;The house was conveniently located in an area that is more of residential rather than touristic, which I liked. The hosts were very friendly, too :)
7068872;149007281;2017-05-02;30600493;Karen;great location, recommend train to/from airport.  beautiful Danish flat, definitely hygge.  access to kitchen and laundry very helpful when staying more than a few days.
7068872;150560991;2017-05-08;63540972;Zach;"Joachim and Elaine have a wonderful place and are great hosts. Their apartment very clean and is in a great location. Public transportation is close and convenient, but walking to many attractions, stores, are restaurants is possible as well. Biking, however, is the quickest and most Danish way to get around, and they will lend you a bike if that's what you'd like to do. 

We didn't have too much time to chat, but when we did, they were both very friendly and helpful. I would recommend anyone travelling to Copenhagen to stay with Joachim and Elaine, your stay will be comfortable and happy."
17743017;158341284;2017-06-06;5353759;Robert;For us the best thing about Rasmus's apartment was the well-equipped kitchen. The quality of crockery, cutlery, other utensils and the comprehensive cookware (pots, pans etc) was the best we have ever experienced in an Airbnb. We like to cook as well as dine out and cooking here was a breeze. Thank you! Some may want to know that the apartment is on the 3rd floor up five flights of stairs. We coped. We also coped with the fact that there was no storage or hanging space for clothes, as all available space was taken up with Rasmus's and his partner's clothing.  The apartment is about 15-20 minutes bus ride from the city and in a very vibrant neighbourhood with a mix of Mediterranean and Arabic cultures, well-served by fruit and vegetable stores and supermarkets.
4233807;148280221;2017-04-30;126914685;Cristina;Perfect for family with kids. The house is cozy and very comfortable, making it feel your own.
3432344;88051209;2016-07-23;64332400;C;Perfect place with perfect host. Very tastefully furnished, and especially the  kitchen equipment was complete and of very high quality. We loved the proximity to the water and public pool. Very suitable for children, with a playground in the courtyard and nice toys in the apartment. Easy to get to the city by boat or bus. We would come back any time!
3432344;101149092;2016-09-12;90494536;Leonidas;Everything was ready waiting for me
9922581;76969106;2016-05-30;17876266;Bea;Sara has a really nice and well located flat. It was a super nice stay for my friends. I can totally recommand this to everybody looking for a nice time in copenhagen!
9922581;90664132;2016-08-01;82445518;Miles;Sara's place is really great. Very close to shops, restaurants and the bus stop to get to the center of the city. We had a lovely time in Copenhagen, made all the more pleasant by this lovely apartment.
9922581;92109585;2016-08-07;71973440;Hannah;Ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt! Die Wohnung lag perfekt, in Nørrebro selbst gibt es einiges zu entdecken und mit dem Bus 66 ist man sofort in der Innenstadt. Sauber, gut ausgestattet, netter Empfang - jederzeit wieder!
4458942;24974004;2015-01-04;4423590;Lise;Super godt ophold hos Sanne, som dog ikke selv var hjemme under opholdet. Dejligt værelse, lækkert køkken og hyggelig stue. Og super sød og hjælpsom roomie! Vi nød vores dage i København - og ikke mindst Asti'en som lå og ventede på os da vi kom, og som blev åbnet nytårsaften!
4458942;34475322;2015-06-08;30462249;Eleonora;We had a really nice time in Copenhagen. The house is in a good position, right behind one of the main streets of Vestebrø and really close to the city centre and the central station. The room is quite big and well lit, and the atmosphere is really nice. We were welcomed by Sanne's flatmate Carlos, who has been lovely to us, and gave some information as well. My boyfriend and I warmly recommended this room!
4458942;56592592;2015-12-15;45120122;Jana Christina;Staying at Sanne's apartment was very nice. It's in a very cool and calm neighborhood not far from the central station or the meatpacking district where you can find a lot of good restaurants and bars. Sanne herself was not there during our stay, but her sweet roommate Carlos was and we had some nice conversations in the evening. The kitchen was fully equipped and we could do some cooking which was very comfortable. The bed was okay, but for two people (not being a couple) maybe a little bit too small (that totally depends on your sleeping habits...) and too soft for my taste. All in all we had a good Airbnb-experience in Copenhagen and enjoyed our stay very much.
4458942;103090355;2016-09-20;8052628;Giovanna;"La casa si trova in una posizione abbastanza strategica non lontano dal centro e vicina alla stazione dei treni (15 minuti a piedi).
Durante il nostro soggiorno Sanne non era presente a casa ma si è organizzata in modo eccellente per farci avere le chiavi e permetterci di entrare. Per quanto riguarda la valutazione sulla casa devo dire che:
-la cucina è ben attrezzata e spaziosa 
-la camera da letto molto grande e con un bel terrazzo
-Il bagno è veramente minuscolo (molto più di quanto appare in foto) 
Complessivamente il giudizio sul soggiorno è buono, altra nota positiva è il coinquilino di Sanne che è simpaticissimo ed è stato molto gentile con noi"
18531065;152813257;2017-05-18;13185965;Tad;Amalies place is very bright and modern. Well decorated and clean too. Located a short walk from a metro station which takes you into the centre in less than 10 mins and just a bit longer to the airport. Communication was easy, quick and concise. Her friend dropped off the key as she was away, she came on exactly the arranged time so there was no waiting about involved.
6474935;39193183;2015-07-21;349679;Eva;Actually, we never met Laura face-to-face. However, Laura is the perfect host as everything worked smoothly (booking procedures, arranging the handing-over for the keys). Her appartement is really very nicely furnished, well-equipped and quiet. Laura even sent us back a necklace, that our daughter forgot. I can really recommend her place.
6474935;39647047;2015-07-25;9239194;Pascal;"Wir hatten eine schöne Zeit in Kopenhagen und haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt.

7814497;116398220;2016-11-30;41470287;Carmen;It's a lovely and cozy apartment.  The neighborhood is great, super convenient for groceries shopping, lots of choices for restaurants and transport to city center and airport is easy too.  One thing to remind travelers with big luggages though, there're no elevators.  Having said that, everything is perfect and I would highly recommend their place.
7814497;116893791;2016-12-04;48760186;Aina;The apartment is exactly what we expected. You will be staying in a really comfortable and well decorated flat. The owners are always available and it only takes 10min to the city center. Totally recommended!
2915596;19572572;2014-09-14;662731;James;Christian has a simple place. If you're looking for an authentic place to stay and experience everyday life then this is it. The candles at night with the windows open were perfect. No Wi-Fi. Christian was very nice.
17181182;148303269;2017-04-30;123057682;Maria;"Lars was such a nice host and we felt so welcome to stay at his apartement. He was flexible with the check in and gave us great tips what we could do in Copenhagen.

The apartement was great and the location was perfect for us. Easy to find a way from the airport and near the city but still far enough so that you could see a bit more than just the tourist areas. Walking distance from the Zoo and bus stop around the corner. The Valby train station was near too and there were many crocery stores near by.

Perfect place to stay for a long weekend or even longer."
18218713;157010460;2017-06-02;27226578;Stephanie;Luna is a great hostess. Very patient and accommodating the room is extremely comfy and nicely decorated. The house is clean and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again!

Thanks."
12902913;154989114;2017-05-27;9786814;Lisa;"The location is perfect to discover Kopenhagen by bicycle as well as with the public transport. From the main station it takes you about 10 minutes by bus. 
Jon was always very quick in answering our questions and was really kind. 
The flat was quiet and the main bed was really comfortable so we had a good sleep. The bakery at the end of the street is perfect!!! 
We would come back for sure.
Thank you Jon"
927228;68456449;2016-04-05;12595244;Nicolas;Cosy, comfy and cute little flat with a great location, just perfect for a week-end in CPH!
3350151;16783459;2014-08-02;9128970;Sergio;My stay in Williams apartment was really good. Really cosy place in a great location. William was a very cool host
3350151;33469719;2015-05-28;18075531;Cristie;"Williams lejlighed var omend endnu skønnere end forventet fra billederne , super hyggelig, praktisk og overskueligt indrettet- jeg følte mig hjemme fra jeg trådte ind af døren . William var yderst hjælpsom som vært, behagelig og let at kommunikere med. Udover udsigten, som virkelig er fabelagtig, var der yderligere en luksus nemlig projektor og Netflix , så jeg kunne slappe af med en god film efter arbejde... Herligt! 
Jeg nød også roen og udsigten til træerne på volden fra soveværelset..... Åbent vindue og opvågning med solsortesang midt i byen- det er godt . 
Christianshavn er helt centralt - jeg kunne cykle på arbejde i midtbyen på 10 minutter, og der er god thai-takeout og hvad hjertet ellers kan begære på torvet få minutters gang fra lejligheden . I det hele taget er stedet et fint udgangspunkt hvis man vil udforske byen på gåben eller cykel . Jeg gik nogle skønne aftenture rundt på voldanlægget og ned langs Islands brygge... Ud i det grønne. Jeg kan varmt anbefale Williams sted."
3350151;33820831;2015-06-01;27713514;Tim;Had a great time in Copenhagen. Made greater by having the opportunity to stay at William's beautiful apartment. I felt we got a sense of what it's like to live in this city.
16459047;131374778;2017-02-12;31410619;Meri;The apartment was beautiful and well-equipped in a vibrant neighborhood. Kamil was a great host as he gave us plenty of advice about Copenhagen. Would definitely recommend staying at his place!
16459047;133256883;2017-02-21;106413284;Kayleigh;"This apartment is absolutely beautiful. It is very spacious, and well equipped. The building is incredibly quiet, and we heard no noise from any neighbours.
The location is great with easy access to efficient and frequent modes of public transport. As well as lots of supermarket type shops nearby.
The host is great and always contactable throughout your stay. Day or night. We were greeted warmly on arrival to the country as well as the home. The host also offered support to find the apartment. 
Conversations happened before our arrival to ensure we had everything we would need/want to know. 
I would highly recommend booking this apartment, and will personally be looking to book here again on my return to Copenhagen.
Many thanks."
8497697;51991161;2015-10-25;46468297;Roser;It's a really nice and cozy room. The whole flat was clean and tidy and we felt so comfortable. We'd recommend this place for sure if you want private space and nice company!

Tak før hyggelige dage og den cykler ;)"
8497697;79856480;2016-06-14;62911663;Lilla;"We really enjoy to stay at Klara's apartment. The room is in a very quiet neighbourhood. The apartment is small but very well organized (even if it's not so easy to climb into the bed). Klara answer very quickly at our questions and she's gave us very good tips for Kobenhavn.  Her roomate is very nice and discreet. Nice place to be and only 15minutes by bicycles to the center of the city; and only 5 minutes from the very hip quarter Norrebro."
8497697;90158712;2016-07-31;81274533;Justine;Cosy appartment in Cph. It's really easy to go to the city center with the busses because they pass very often. Klara is very helpfull and we loved meet her. I could join Klara any time, she was very available.

13823190;95934866;2016-08-21;34356715;Annamaria;"Scandinavian design at its best! The apartment is super nice and cosy. 
Mette was very helpful before and during our stay. Even though we arrived super late in the night she still managed for someone to hand over the keys and helped us with directions from the airport and other questions we had.
We stayed for two nights and were getting around town easily by bike. The Nørrebro neighborhood offers a lot of nice places but it is also not too far to the center of Copenhagen. 
All in all, we felt at home and enjoyed out stay a lot!"

There is a bycyclen rental station near the apartment, at Amager metro station, and that is a great way to see Copenhagen! Recommendation.
10426182;102526927;2016-09-18;30344950;Melissa;Suleman was great with communication prior to arrival.  Place was small but perfect for a short stay in Copenhagen.  Bring your own toiletries including soap!
14446696;96495852;2016-08-23;34912313;Wesley;Ruben's apartment in Copenhagen was perfect, it's clean, bright and quiet. It's ideal for a weekend getaway, holiday or business trip. The breeze flowed through the open planned layout and you can see the surrounding buildings and green trees from the top floor with complete privacy. Ruben greeted me upon arrival with all of the information required. He documented his favourite places to eat out in Frederiksberg and I wish I had more time to visit them all. This was a true personal Airbnb experience with a lovely warm feel in a real home. I would recommend Ruben's place to anyone wanting a great experience in Copenhagen. Thanks again for an awesome stay.
5831189;39751971;2015-07-26;32520946;Clemens;Nice furnished flat as announced in central position and short distance to metrostation. We got a kind welcome from the owners and everything was easy to handle. A good place to stay with children. We felt like home and enjoyed our time in Copenhagen.

Litt minus på renslighet, men fikk forklart at hun prøvde et nytt vaskefirma og skulle ta kontakt med dem om tilbakemeldingene. I tillegg var Nanna veldig snill og hjalp oss med spørsmål ang. hvordan vi tok oss rundt i København, fra og til flyplass. Absloutt å anbefale :)"
7520059;92288247;2016-08-08;9642562;Helen;"Jeg og min venn ankom København tidlig en morgen, og selv om ikke Nanna hadde mulighet til å treffe oss personlig ga hun oss god instrukser for å finne frem og kode til nøkkelboks, som fungerte veldig bra. Leiligheten var stor, lys og moderne. 

Beliggenheten til leiligheten var perfekt og vi gikk alle steder vi skulle. Nanna ga oss gode tips for caféer, barer og restauranter i nærområdet og var ellers en veldig bra vert. 

Leiligheten og verten er absolutt å anbefale!"
4028881;20117503;2014-09-23;21196919;Jitka;Anne is a great host and her flat so nice and comfortable! It is clean, good size, furnished and decorated in beautiful retro style. It is abt 5 min walk to the train station, 2 stops to Central Station, and about 20-30 min walk to centre of Copenhagen (depends where you want to get). Even though I met Anne just shortly, she seems very friendly, easygoing and fun person. She prepared a nearby area guide for us and also sent SMS now and then just to check up if everything was going fine. If I ever come to Copenhagen again, I would certainly check if Anne's flat is available again and would recommend it to all my friends! Our short holiday break was so nice and relaxed thanks to Anne as well!
4028881;28746189;2015-03-29;10975811;Silvia;Very good place to stay near the city centre. Unfortunately we couldn't meet Anne but she found a very easy way to leave us the keys. She provide us with very good information to get her apartment. Place was tidy and clean with all comforts! Very colourful and relaxing!
4028881;32456406;2015-05-18;3112296;Ashley;Great apartment, even the bed was really comfortable.  The decorations are right on, we spent extra minutes exploring cute little creative things she'd done with the place.  The location is excellent.  Close to the metro, close to restaurants and groceries, just on the outskirts of Vesterbro.
4028881;62195951;2016-02-12;55358142;Chun Kai;非常親切的房東,會用她的生活經驗告訴我們哪裡可以玩,哪裡可以逛,哪裡有丹麥傳統食物可以吃,整個公寓也非常的可愛非常舒適!非常非常好的房東!
4028881;75294965;2016-05-20;61549322;Katie;I would echo all of the positive comments that have been posted before.  Anne was quick with answering questions and had great suggestions.  Her apartment is perfectly located and beautifully designed.  Everything was comfortable and cozy with plenty of room for three people.  I highly recommend staying here and will definitely do so if I'm lucky enough to be back.  Tak!

5471859;55507527;2015-12-01;1545572;Agathe;"We had a great stay in Jeroen´s apartment. The location is very good if you want to visit the city and at the same time enjoy a quiet neighborhood. In about 5-10 min walk you can reach Jordaan with all the shops and restaurants.
The flat is well furnished, with everything you need and also very clean. Jeroen is a flexible host and it was easy to organise ourselves. We recommend his place"
12503509;89841062;2016-07-30;11778063;Jo;"Großartiges Erlebnis: Wahlweise auf der Dachterasse, im Wohnzimmer schaukelnd oder auf der Hängematte den Blick auf die Amstel genießen und den Ruderern zuzuschauen! Alleine das ist schon so entspannend, dass man gar nicht mehr raus muss. Das wäre natürlich zu schade, denn Amsterdam ist ja eine schöne Stadt! Also haben wir mehrfach das kleine Boot genutzt, dass der Vermieter kostenfrei gegen Pfand zur Verfügung stellt und sind durch die Grachten geschippert! Auch sehr entspannend. Vor allem, weil man dem Touristentrubel total entgeht! Toll war auch die Sonos-Box, mit der man jederzeit Musik hören kann. Das Viertel De Pijp in direkter Nachbarschaft war auch schön, auch wenn man da 5-15 Minuten laufen muss (sowohl zum Supermarkt als auch zu diversen Kneipen).
Alles in allem ein echtes Erlebnis! Wir würden definitiv wiederkommen!"
12503509;98470333;2016-08-31;2779580;Evelin;Simply AMAZING, I think we just had the best possible stay in this wonderful city! Thank you Mattijs for this extraordinary experience. We couldn't recommend your magic houseboat on the river more.
13385603;123904053;2016-12-31;7303729;Diego;It was a pleasure to be in Mireille´s place. It was cosy flat and near to the center. She was very helpfull in the arrival. I would recomend her flat.
7178130;47078879;2015-09-15;8120027;Ed;"Angella's apartment is exactly as she has described it to be. It is peaceful, clean and uncluttered, allowing one to relax, before and after a long day of activities in the hustle and bustle of the city. The views are pleasant from the front and the back balcony. Angella provided us with much useful information on our trip and welcomed us with bouquets, a bottle of wine and grocery gift card which came in really handy. Her apartment is close to the west end of VoldenPark. It is a short pleasant walk (20min-25min) to great museums such as the Rijks Museum. By tram 1 from Centraal Station, you can get there in about 25 minutes. Within a few blocks away, there are grocery stores, deli, bakery, restaurants, shops and such for day-to-day needs.  We had a lovely time in her apartment.

One more thing, Angella was very flexible in handling the keys to her apartment. As a result, we do not have any issue getting into her apartment.

If you like walking and don't mind climbing narrow stairs in Dutch buildings, this place may suit you well."
7178130;55623219;2015-12-03;41503847;Enzo;Angella was super attentive and her place was Super clean and comfortable with easy access to the center of town. Angella made sure we felt right at home during our 1 week stay.
7178130;74918773;2016-05-17;19216751;E;"Fantastic apartment!
Immaculately clean!
Very comfortable bed, and best shower I've experienced in Europe.
Perfect location for quiet, but a short distance to the noise of Amsterdam.
Great hostess, very helpful.
Apartment is better than pics. Cozy, but quite big for Amsterdam"
13232905;83796415;2016-07-04;34000516;Jaz;This was an absolutely fantastic spot in Amsterdam! Walking distance to Anne Frank's house and paddle boating. We had a blast.
13232905;89212592;2016-07-27;2722806;Loïc;Great place in the heart of the city, around everything. The appart was a described. We did not meet viola but she made sure everything was in the right place for us. Definitely would recomand it!

13232905;116389597;2016-11-30;11771713;Bryan;This apartment is beautifully decorated and in an amazing location just walking distance to the city center. It's cozy and quaint, the bathroom is gorgeous, and the bed was very comfortable. Also, Viola made it very easy to check in and helpful providing restaurant recommendations as well. I highly reccomend this apartment for anyone coming to Amsterdam to visit for work or play!

16224376;127962486;2017-01-22;68072154;Bernardo;Suyun was such an amazing host. She was really friendly and helpful. The apartment is right in the Center of Amsterdam and you can go by walk to wherever you want to visit.
3590188;39842662;2015-07-26;38242144;Giorgia;Our stay in Amsterdam has been great. Unluckily we didn't meet Stefan, but his flatmate welcomed us in the best way. My friend and I were definitely at our ease. We had to share the bathroom with other guests, but there have been no problems at all as everyone was really nice, clean and tidy. If you rent a bike it's pretty easy to reach the centre in a few minutes, but there are also tram and bus stops just down the street. If we'll ever go back in A'dam we would definitely stay again there. Recommended!
8946277;75419641;2016-05-21;23938439;Chris T.;The greatest host ever? The room was clean, the balcony was amazing and she even left us chocolates and water. I would go back if I could.

1429701;8099744;2013-10-15;8084458;Raphael;Ayla was very friendly! The room was very clean and the bed truly good! Location is good (near train station and streets with several bars/restaurants).

1429701;28396809;2015-03-23;27467250;Virginie;Charmant petit bateau à 15 minutes à pieds de la Gare Centrale et à 10 mins à pieds du quartier vivant de Haarlemmerstraat.  Malheureusement, la météo ne nous a pas permis de profiter de la terrasse, mais le logement était douillet et cosy.
1429701;37648708;2015-07-09;28529961;Jeremy;Ayla and Jake were very nice and welcoming!  They were able to accommodate a late check in (our flight from Berlin was late!) and when we arrived, they had a candle lit for us.  The space was charming and romantic, exactly what we were hoping for.  They were very helpful in giving us information about things to do and check out, and they left cookies, a bottle of wine and Dutch beer for us to nosh on.  We would ABSOLUTELY recommend them to anyone and hope our paths will cross again soon.
1429701;58949547;2016-01-05;5680600;Paul;Ayala and Jake’s houseboat was the perfect and memorable way to spend a few quick days in Amsterdam. They both greeted me as I arrived, provided a wealth of city sightseeing and food options to fill my time perfectly and made me feel right at home. The houseboat is impeccably outfitted, cozy and centrally located providing easy access to all the city has to offer while being off the beaten path enough to escape the hustle of the center of the city. I will definitely be staying with them again when my travels have me back in Amsterdam!
1429701;61364881;2016-02-03;14242002;Steve;"The houseboat on the canal provided by Ayla and Jake was absolutely wonderful and far exceeded my expectations of what staying on a canal boat would be like, having never stayed on one before! Me and my girlfriend were greeted with a lovely bottle of wine and even a fridge with beers and milk in it which was a lovely touch! The boat itself was perfect for two people, with plenty of space. The weather at the time in Amsterdam was extremely wet and cold but the temperature as soon as you walked inside the boat was lovely and toasty! 

The area is fantastic, very quiet and easily within walking distance to the central station as well as some other nice parts of Amsterdam that we were able to explore during some downtime. 

Overall I highly recommend to anyone planning on staying in Amsterdam to choose this listing, as it is wonderful, full of character  and ideally situated. I'm already pondering a trip back in the summer to see how it is when the weather is a little better and I'd be able to sit outside!"
1429701;72791597;2016-05-04;66310709;Stephanie;Ayla&Jake sind wundervolle Gastgeber sie haben ein bei fragen sofort zur Seite gestanden, das hausboot ist super schön und der weg in die Stadt ist Ruckzuck geschafft.  Wir werden jeder zeit zurück kommen weil einfach alles perfekt ist.
1429701;84408522;2016-07-07;45864406;Jan;"Ayla and Jake were superb hosts. The boat was very comfortable--peaceful and easy to rest. 
Enjoyed visits with Ayla and her accommodating me when my IPhone would not cooperate. 
Would stay again"
1429701;91400393;2016-08-05;50483598;Jon;Jake and Ayla's houseboat was the perfect way to experience Amsterdam. The boat was beautiful inside and out and was in great condition, very clean and had everything one needed to live comfortably. The boat was a quick walk away from everywhere we wanted to be in the city. Check in and check out could not have been easier and more timely. I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a real houseboat experience in Amsterdam and would certainly go back myself.
1429701;99732992;2016-09-05;13781041;Devon;The absolute perfect way to spend your time in Amsterdam and get a totally different experience than staying in a hotel or apartment. Perfect location to the sites of Amsterdam. The breakfast voucher, wine and beer were such a great touch and greatly appreciated. Thank you Ayla, we will be back!!
1429701;100380726;2016-09-09;60553107;Kyle;Great area and amazing location had a great view. Bed was larger than expected. Jake and Ayla were great host and answered questions to the T.
1429701;105792796;2016-10-02;27855666;Nicola;Wir haben uns so wohl gefühlt, dass wir sicherlich nochmal buchen werden. Ayla und Jake sind total nette und herzliche Menschen, es macht Freude, mit ihnen in Kontakt zu sein. Es war für uns ein traumhaft schöner Aufenthalt. Innerhalb von wenigen Minuten ist man am Bahnhof und auch die umliegenden Lokalitäten sind zu empfehlen. Danke für einen so schönen Platz, wir können diese Unterkunft bedenkenlos emphehlen.
1429701;138558495;2017-03-20;7141236;Tanya;We had a lovely stay at Jake & Ayla's place. It was a nice, clean cosy space-ideal for a couple. It was very central and close to The cool neighbourhood of Jordaan. Jake checked us in and gave us all of the info we needed. There was great attention to detail with a tea/coffe & lovely biscuits. They provided a detailed guide to Amsterdam. I would definitely recommend staying here!

Yasmin a été très réactive dans tous nos échanges avant, après et pendant notre séjour. Toutes les informations qu'elle nous a donné nous ont permis d'arriver sans stress à Amsterdam et de trouver le logement facilement et rapidement.
Le logement était propre avec tout le nécessaire de toilette et la cuisine bien équipée. Même si l'appartement se trouve sur la rive opposée face à la gare, il est très facile d'y accéder en ferry, bus ou vélo. 
Je recommande cet appartement et cette hôte qui a été très à l'écoute et disponible"

Il quartiere tranquillo e al tempo stesso ben servito da mezzi di trasporto e locali in cui mangiare e fare colazione. Rialloggerei nell'appartamento di Bianca molto volentieri."
3017962;22682906;2014-11-11;1805372;Blaise;The perfect place to stay in Amsterdam: well connected to the city centre (Centraal Station - ca. 10 minutes by metro), to the museums (with tramway - 10 minutes), to the nightlife (e.g. Leidseplein, 15 minutes by tram). The apartment has a superb view on the Amstel (it makes you want to stay home!), is in a quiet area, yet close to supermarkets and metro station (Wibaustraat) and has all the necessary appliances. Sophie is really helpful, advises very well and is very reactive. Bedankt!! Warmly recommended !!
3017962;66794400;2016-03-24;34461311;Mareike;We really enjoyed our stay at Sophies and Rubens appartement. Ruben welcomed us warmly and gave us all informations needed.The appartement itself is lovely, exspecially the bright and spacious living room with its amazing amstel view. we travelled with our little son and Ruben and Sophie were really helpful organizing a little baby bed for us from the neighboues. We definitely would stay there again
3017962;100854010;2016-09-11;6792762;Alexis;Sophie was a great host - she provided quick responses and generously didn't make me replace a wine glass I broke! The flat was in a lovely location, just a five-minute walk from the Metro, with really easy access to the City Centre. It's a gorgeous, spacious flat with a unique feel and a fantastic view. I highly recommend it!
3017962;138237103;2017-03-19;110465219;Emil;Our stay at Sophie's apartment was wonderful, we were positively surprised by our stay since the pictures don't do the place justice! The view over the canal really is great and the amount of people in the neighborhood is perfect (neither crowded or empty). We'd recommend this apartment for anyone who's planning to travel to Amsterdam!

Flavio is a nice guy. If you have any questions about your trip to Amsterdam, you can ask him and he will help you. His house is clean and absolutely perfect for a trip to Amsterdam. If we are in Amsterdam again, we'll come back."

7332860;55627515;2015-12-03;49334726;Claudine;L'appartement est conforme aux photos, Flavio nous a reçu le 1er jour et nous l'avons revu la veille de notre départ. Il est plutôt aimable mais ne propose aucun renseignement sur la ville, ni plan. La chambre ressemble à un couloir et le matelas est vraiment très fin donc le lit est trop dur à notre goût. Un wc au rendez-de-chaussée dans l'entrée, un escalier assez raide conduit au niveau de la chambre, du séjour et de la cuisine et il faut monter un deuxième escalier identique au premier pour accéder à la salle de bain. Le quartier est calme et situé à 20/25 mn du centre en tramway.
7332860;56889390;2015-12-19;44765100;Martín Sebastián;Flavio is such an amazing guest! He gave us good instructions to arrive easily to the flat. When we arrived, he received us speaking spanish! It was a very nice surprise as we were a bit nervous cause was the first time that we rent an AIRBNB. The room was cleaned and ordered and Flavio gave us our space with freedom. I recommend his flat as his attention is awesome :) Muchas gracias por todo, amigo!

You need about 10 minutes to the central station and the tram leaves  every 5 minutes right in front of the house.
All in all we will definitely come back!"

Ci ha accolti bene e ci ha dato tante indicazioni e consigli per vivere bene Amsterdam. La fermata del tram a due passi da casa per raggiungere in poco tempo il centro città. Lo consiglio altamente. :-)
7332860;104839413;2016-09-28;67565030;Tal;"we werent sure about air bnb at first but knew that hotel is too much expensive. we found flavio's room in the web and read the great reviews so we slept there for 7 nights  and it was super awsome. the room is big, the kitchen has everything you need, and its only 10-15 minutes from the central station in a quiet place. the tram comes every 5-7 minutes so its very comfortable. flavio was nice and kind, helped use and gave his advices. 
if you need a good place to stay in, without paying your montly paycheck, flavio's appartment is a great idea!!"
7332860;122256032;2016-12-22;12386636;Audris;"My boyfriend and I actually stayed for almost 2 weeks at Flávio's place; we just had to change rooms. This second room was a bit bigger and warmer than the one on the 2nd floor one. But both were clean and had the same furniture (comfortable bed, a cabinet, mirror and a set of drawers). I personally preferred this room since it was facing the complex, instead of the street. So one could hear less noise from the cars and the tram passing by.

Flávio was very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay. He provided coffee and tea for the guests, and was also kind enough to allow the washing of our clothes. He also offered to take us to the airport for a reasonable price. He is certainly one of the best Airbnb hosts I've encountered so far."

The bedroom includes a walk on balcony with a spectacular view overlooking the canal. Joelma is a very welcoming host and recommended the many places, including the pancake restaurant which you must try. Do not eat anything for at least a few hours before going to the pancake restaurant as the portion sizes and phenomenal. There are also several really great places very close to the apartment to enjoy a few drink etc. The centre of Amsterdam is about 15 minutes walk and bikes are available to hire from the host at very reasonable prices. Joelma allowed us to stay an extra few hours after the check out time which we really appreciated. Thanks Joelma you are a fantastic host and it was a real pleasure to meet you during our short visit to your home town Amsterdam. Elodie and Carl

7225021;125710397;2017-01-07;57972025;Nichole;As soon as we got here the host gave us a map and answered any questions we had. Extremely nice people! I would definitely come back here
7225021;128491013;2017-01-25;7682545;Angela;"Getting to the apartment was easy; Joelma and Roland greeted me with lots of info and a map. They answered all my questions and offered suggestions on what to do in the limited time I had. My room and the house was very clean and comfortable. I hope to stay here again!"
7225021;129889767;2017-02-03;96982475;Florent;"Nous avons été très bien accueilli par la femme de Roland après avoir trouvé facilement le logement (moins de 10 minutes à pied de la gare). La chambre est comme sur la photo, la litterie confortable et la cuisine toute équipée à disposition ! 
Nous avons suivie les conseils pour les restos et les quartiers à visiter, faite le aussi! Les conseils sont excellent ! 
Roland nous a loué ses vélos pour la journée, très pratique pour visiter Amsterdam et profiter du grand air !"
7225021;131874640;2017-02-14;33502392;Bence;We had 3 very nice days in Roland's and Joelma's apartment. The room was clean, and had a nice view to the canals. The neighbourhood was quite but everything (centre of Amsterdam etc.) was close. I can only recommend this place to stay!
7225021;137425152;2017-03-15;25282019;Katie;My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Roland's. She was very accommodating. The room was spacious and had a great balcony view of the canals. We had every thing we needed for a comfortable stay and enjoyed the location. Close walk to Amsterdam Centraal. Overall, great stay! Would definitely recommend.
14082726;131476453;2017-02-12;82284246;James;"Where to start.  The booking process and communication was great, the pictures look great and everything appeared to be in order for a good trip.  We arrived at the apartment and the first thing to note is the stairs - there are 3 flights of them and they are so STEEP and WINDING that it was very difficult to get luggage up to the apartment.  On entering the home, we were disappointed - the furnishing is cheap and the apartment was not clean.  We were expecting a 5 star penthouse and what we really got was a 2.5/3 star.  There were patches of paint on the walls, mould, leaking skylights, a blind missing, bare wires hanging from the ceiling where light fittings were missing, no headboards on the beds, the shower was blocked and overflowed, the shower head didn't work properly - and there is only ONE bathroom and not two as listed on the Airbnb website.  For such a nice and large apartment, there was only one small TV in the lounge area which did not work.  This is where things got very interesting!  We complained about the TV not working and the host told us we could get out of the apartment and he would help us pack our things!   We did not leave and after chasing the entire next day, a guy arrived with a computer monitor (19"") which was in no way appropriate.  The episode ruined our trip, we felt unwelcome and my wife did not want to leave the apartment because she was afraid our belongings would be removed whilst we were out.  This is absolutely not what we expected from our first Airbnb experience.   Overall a very, very negative experience with this host and their property."
15818103;122691989;2016-12-25;106410710;Kirti;Ingrid has a beautiful home. She is a very good host. Loved the place. Comfortable stay.
8904351;52907118;2015-11-02;11420373;Rhiannon;Martin was an absolutely AMAZING host! I stayed in his apartment in Amsterdam for my birthday weekend and could not have been happier. The apartment was very clean and very modern and had a great view of the city. Martin was also kind enough to decorate his entire apartment in celebratory birthday frills for me! He also left me some chocolate, as well as two Amsterdam guide books, and he went through the trouble of highlighting different places throughout the city that he thought we may like to see and how to get there. Additionally he left us a handful of DVDs to watch on his flat screen:) I 100% recommend staying here to anyone visiting Amsterdam.
8904351;53536095;2015-11-09;19241166;Marika;"We had a very good stay in Amsterdam!

Martin gave us a very warm welcome with insider tipps of locations of amsterdam, a personally guidance through his flat, a nice personal letter and some chocolate.
Furthermore he had a clean and very comfortable flat with an amazing panoramic view!

Next time our first adress to ask for stay in this pretty city amsterdam is: Martin :)

Thanks!!"
8904351;56541548;2015-12-14;50270141;Maximilian;"We had an amazing time in Amsterdam and found that wonderful studio. The apartment was very clean and tidied up. Its perfekt for two visitors! You need about 15 min with the tram to the centre. 
Martin is a great host! He is very flexible with the check in and check out. I would recommend Martin's studio for everyone!"
8904351;69322695;2016-04-10;6112567;Vasily;"Martin was a great host,

we enjoyed our time in Amsterdam.

He has got a fantastic view from his apartment overlooking massive distance.

Flat is clean and comfortable situated in quiet area not far from Central part or Airport."
8904351;83626331;2016-07-03;18566214;Anna;Wir hatten einen großartigen Aufenthalt in Martins appartment. Martin war jederzeit erreichbar, hat uns sehr nett empfangen, uns viele Tipps gegeben und sich rührend gekümmert. Das appartment war super schön, sehr ordentlich und sauber und hatte alle Annehmlichkeiten inklusive einer tollen Aussicht .. Vor allem der Sonnenaufgang war wunderschön... Das appartment ist super gut von Amsterdam Central mit dem Bus zu erreichen und liegt angenehm in einer reinen Wohngegend außerhalb des Grachten-Rummels.. Wir fanden es richtig gemütlich und würden sofort wieder dort Einchecken ... Danke schön für alles Martin .. Dank u well (or Similar)
8904351;89387280;2016-07-28;74260318;Susanne;"The apartment was great and exactly how it looked on the pictures. Very clean and there was everything you needed. 
Martin really cared about us. We could always call or text him and he really wanted us to make ourselves comfy at his apartment. 
Location is also great. Although not directly in the city center, you can reach this easily by bus or tram, the area us very cute and has cute little cafes or restaurants. The P+R parking garage is about 3 minutes walk from the apartment which was also really good as we arrived by car. 
All in all a great place to stay which we can absolutely recommend!"
8904351;136731753;2017-03-12;110840973;Ionut;Great place, amazing view and a beautiful city. Martin was really helpful and kind. :)
852145;14949846;2014-06-30;12737873;Roger;This was a great location, close to the city centre, tourist sites, transport links and restaurants.  The apartment is very well appointed.  We will definitely stay here again when visiting Amsterdam and recommend it to friends.  It was quiet and felt safe too.
852145;29725329;2015-04-12;26001734;Thalia;"Thank you Nancy and Synco for your warm and friendly welcome. Everything went well smoothly and easy. 
The location of the flat is very central. There are separate facilities for each bedroom which perfectly suits a stay with friends.
Thank you again!"
852145;41313290;2015-08-07;28148493;Kristien;"Deze locatie is top !! Geweldige ligging, nette moderne ruimte, aangename gastheer en -vrouw, een echte aanrader !
Groetjes Kristien en kids"
852145;45062276;2015-08-31;7757170;Katie;Great apartment in fantastic location. Lots of thought has gone into the apartment and Synco was really welcoming and helpful. Brilliant stay and would highly recommend.
852145;71892598;2016-04-29;926740;Andrew;"Synco was a friendly and accommodating host, welcoming us (early) with coffee and conversation in his home upstairs while we waited for the downstairs apartment to become available.  He provided a map and list of everything in the area including restaurants, bike rental, grocery store and bakery, canal tours, etc., and pointed out his personal favorites.  He also called and arranged a taxi to the airport for us.

The apartment was exactly as described and photographed, and in a perfect location:  directly on a major canal right around the corner from stylish shops, restaurants, and a short walk to major tram lines.  Dam Square, Anne Frank House, and the Jordaan neighborhood are all just a few minutes walk.  Stairs down from the street to the front door and up to the second bedroom are steep but manageable (this is typical for houses in Amsterdam).

We walked to the nearby grocery store and bought fresh eggs, bacon, butter and milk, and to the bakery for bread and pastries, and cooked our own breakfast.  The kitchen had all the pans, dishes, glasses and utensils we needed, and Nespresso coffee machine, stove, oven, fridge and dishwasher."
852145;78720638;2016-06-08;2885118;Diane;Synco made us feel very welcome and was a kind and helpful host. The apartment was very comfortable and in a great location right on a canal with lots of facilities nearby. It was a safe and pretty neighbourhood which we enjoyed exploring. Thanks Synco.
852145;83342119;2016-07-02;5389228;Marc;Synco’s apartment is terrific. It is clean, spacious, comfortable, quiet, and looks even nicer than the pictures. It is conveniently located near the train station (10 minute walk) and all that Amsterdam has to offer. Synco was very friendly and easy to deal with. He accommodated our early arrival and allowed us to drop off our luggage earlier than check in. He even left flowers and a bottle of wine for us. Synco was very responsive to our emails, texts and calls. I would highly recommend this apartment.
852145;98802162;2016-09-01;28045422;Shakira;The house was perfect! Synco is such a nice host. The house was clean and exactly as advertise. Near to the central and also the tram. Whoever is thinking of visiting Amsterdam, please go ahead and book this house. Such a lovely place to stay during your vacation.
852145;108879802;2016-10-17;20367577;Gareth;The flat is in a beautiful part of town with loads of restaurants and bars. Synco was a very friendly host and welcomed us at the flat on arrival, even providing a helpful map of activities in the area. It's basically everything you could want for a city break in Amsterdam.
852145;114137014;2016-11-15;35364616;Shelly;Great apartment in a central location, a short walk from central station and tourist areas and close to some nice local cafes and shops. Clean, well maintained apartment - and Synco kindly allowed us to drop our bags off early before the official check in time. A great place to stay in Amsterdam.

852145;130918280;2017-02-09;22781168;Glenn;Fantastic accommodation in a great position in town. Very accommodating host! Highly recommended.
12954766;87491042;2016-07-20;22728344;Maggie;Jochen was an incredible host. The houseboat itself was absolutely incredible, amazing kitchen, rooms, comfortable beds, and amazing living room. The location can not get any better, right near the tram station that gets you to central station, and in the coolest part of town. Jochum was extremely accommodating, made sure we had everything we needed, and ensured we had the most memorable time. When I'm back in Amsterdam, I am definitely trying to book here again!
12954766;88456153;2016-07-24;34233287;Adam;"Jochum's boat is in a good location in a quiet part of the city. It is a 15 min walk to central station and from there you can explore the city. It is a spacious boat. 
We had a leak of one of the common outlet pipes, which Jochum promptly started to fix at 6am in the morning and worked all day to fix. He was a very attentive and nice man, and a great host."
16624565;130905676;2017-02-09;30690433;Claire;Very nice and well-located flat in the picturesque Jordaan neighbourhood. Mark and Maartje were very caring and available for the check-in. I recommend it!
16624565;131471799;2017-02-12;5624229;Marie;"The appartment was well organized and functional. We had all what we needed for staying a long weekend in Amsterdam. 
We also really loved the neighborhood around the appartment, canals and small boutiques, where we could shop, go for a walk, and tryed some good restaurants close by. We enjoyed also the walking distance to all the most attractive place in the centrum. 
Mark&Maartje was easy to communicate with and attentive so we could have a nice stay. Thanks for that"
6781848;127830400;2017-01-21;10715201;Marguerite;Great appartement! Would recommend it to anyone! Amazing location as well.
3178188;17484786;2014-08-12;19518556;Erna;"Prima ontvangst. Marcus, was zo vriendelijk mij te helpen mijn zware bagage naar de bovenste verdieping de trappen op te dragen. We hebben de dagen tijdens mijn verblijf leuke gesprekken gehad. Privacy was prima. Een fijne kamer met leuk balkon.
Voor mijn doel was het verblijf in de Bloemstraat een prima centrale plek om de hele Jordaan en de Grachtengordel te verkennen. Fijn rustig straatje. De klanken van de Westertoren en een tram in de verte geven, als het het raam of balkondeur open hebt, aanvullende sfeer."
3178188;19938529;2014-09-21;15965867;Borghild;The room is neat, the balcony outside is perfect for a sunny breakfast or a quiet moment before bed, and the place is in a nice area, very central. Both the room and the rest of the flat is very clean and tidy. Marcus generously gave access to his livingroom and kitchen, and an impressive roof terrace. He also took me along for a boat trip along the canals in his boat, an amazing experience! He is a great host, friendly and open, and made me feel very welcome.
3178188;24008083;2014-12-16;21233777;Juan Carlos;"La experiencia en la la habitación en la casa de Marcus fue genial. Marcus es un gran y hospitalario anfitrión; el cuarto es bastante cómodo, limpio y ordenado. La casa está situada en un lugar muy central de la ciudad. Marcus fue muy amable y me brindó instrucciones muy importantes para conocer la ciudad, utilicé la zona de lavandería, siendo el muy colaborador.  Sí volviera a Amsterdam sin duda regresaría. Gracias Marcus por tu hospitalidad, eres una persona."
3178188;31910084;2015-05-11;24327394;Marie;"Great place, great location and great host! 
Les photos et descriptions du logement sont conformes à la réalité, logement propre, chambre fonctionnelle, balcon agréable.
Idéalement situé dans un des plus beaux quartiers d'Amsterdam, proche du centre et des transports. 
Conseil pour ceux qui viennent en voiture: garez vous au parking P+R Los en Bommel, prenez des tickets GVB au parking, et prenez le tram 14 il est direct jusqu'au logement arrêt ""westermarkt"" (15min). Le P+R coûte 1€/jour (si arrivée après 10h le matin, max 4jours).

3178188;32896988;2015-05-23;249596;Stephen;My stay with Marcus while in Amsterdam went without any problem. Even with my very early morning arrival he was there to greet me and kindly carried my suitcase up five floors. His place is perfect for one person and the view from his rooftop garden is lovely. Marcus is a great host, was helpful in providing all sorts of information and I would highly recommend staying with him.
3178188;43250036;2015-08-18;9353257;Ofelia;"Marcus' apartment is well located, the neighborhood worth the visit, it was my favorite part of all Amsterdam. It is well served and quiet at the same time. I was able to walk everywhere and not use the public transportation. The room was good size for me, nicely decorated and the balcony is really a nice place to relax.
I stayed 3 nights in Marcus' place, he is very friendly and open to give you tips about the city and its culture. He shared almost all his place, which is spotless and cozy at the same time.  I used the fridge to store some food and I enjoyed the tea he has available for guests. 
I will definitely will contact Marcus if I have to go again to Amsterdam. Really good host!"
3178188;45159172;2015-08-31;10845097;Claire;Marcus was a perfect host and his home is lovely. As other reviewers have said, it's really well-located - close to the Westermarkt bus stop in the Jordaan area, which is one of if not the best place to be in Amsterdam. Marcus was friendly and made me feel totally at home. I would absolutely stay here again.
740995;128896469;2017-01-28;6611306;Sandra;Die Lage, am Rande des Stadtkernes mit Metro Haltestelle ein paar Meter neben der Wohnung ist perfekt. Die Wohngegend ist sehr schön. Das Appartement ist geräumig, toll und gemütlich eingerichtet und man fühlt sich sofort wohl. Ich würde sofort wieder dort buchen, um Amsterdam zu erkunden. Die Wohnung ist auch perfekt für eine Familie mit zwei bis drei Kinder.
9037142;62770170;2016-02-16;7362657;Kate;This was a fantastic place to stay! Ruth Christine and family were incredibly welcoming and friendly, and the room was comfortable and clean. There were even fresh hyacinths on the bureau. The apartment, while not directly in the center, is very convenient to both the city and airport by tram, bus, bike, or foot. Would definitely recommend this location and host, and next time I'm in Amsterdam, I will be staying here if I'm lucky!
11000373;76948439;2016-05-29;38086018;Jule;Erika and her husband just did a perfect job. They welcomed us very friendly. Erika answered all my questions before and during our stay immediately and gave really good and helpful recommendations. The house was in a perfect shape and we felt like at home. We were only adults but I guess for children it is just perfect. Not fare (14min by tram) from the central staation it was a good place to get to know Amsterdam. I definately recommend the house and Erikas Family. I certainly come back one day.
14197451;96777295;2016-08-24;23643718;Mark;We really enjoyed staying at Eva's apartment and it felt like home for the week we were there. While not huge, it's very well laid-out so it never feels too small. The location is great - close to the VU and Amsterdam Bos. Eva's cat, Levi, was very affectionate and will be missed!
11703107;72821702;2016-05-04;15021896;Muiz;"Clean and good sized apartment, in a good location.
Lady from Iambnb who met us there was helpful.

Was slightly surprised that we were asked to clean up certain things when there is a cleaning charge.

All in all, a fairly good experience."
6375204;47966588;2015-09-22;4080925;Bryan;The place was very cool and comfortable - it's like staying at a friend's place. It had everything we needed and is in a good location. Check in and out was simple, overall it was an excellent visit!
6375204;64790931;2016-03-08;11131292;Kyle;Check in, the stay, and check out were all great experience. Although not in the city center there are lots of great things to do and very close to the tram. Great experience! Hosts were easy to contact.
2517394;111499483;2016-10-31;11376698;Stephanie;Kirsten is the best host ever! We did not get to see her throughout the 4 night stays but she got back to us promptly whenever we had any questions. The apartment is clean and tidy. An easy bus ride will take you to the central station. Supermarkets and local markets are within few mins walk. Loved especially the fully equipped kitchen. Would definitely love to stay here again!
2517394;133256938;2017-02-21;110956996;Natalie;We loved our stay at Kirsten's place. Very cosy and comfortable. It was great to have the bikes from Kirsten as a quick 5 minute bike ride to the ferry which takes you straight to central station. Then walking distance to town centre. Kirsten has everything need and was also lovely to leave us some food as we had a very late check in. Neighborhood is lovely, a market, supermarket, a couple of pubs and restaurant all across the road. Neighbors we very helpful as our not so helpful taxi driver left us on the main road and we had no idea where the house was within the area. Luckily a man walking down the street helped us and walked with us until we got to the front door at 2am!!To future guests ask the driver to take you to the front door!The cats are also lovely company, James just comes in for food and Missy is no bother and very friendly..we actually miss her.Highly recommended.
8233245;48144323;2015-09-23;44482658;Fabio;The apartment was beautiful and they are very nice people, we will definitly come again! Could not be better!
8233245;50384752;2015-10-11;28982880;Laura;"We were made to feel very welcome! Bert was kind enough to meet us there and ran through everything. A lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us upon arrival too!

The neighbourhood was quiet and had a great market on the Saturday morning with a music band!

Everything was clean and modern and the beds were really comfortable!

Would stay again!"
8233245;55066405;2015-11-27;1489310;Camuel;Everything as expected, nice cosy apartment, plenty of parking on the street, nice home-cinema in the living room. Short walk and free ferry to Amsterdam center.
8233245;71904301;2016-04-29;48553451;Dina;The host is amazing and the house is very nice and clean and the heating system is very good it's if I have the chance next time ill definitely would love to stay again in the same house  everything was super
8233245;74766901;2016-05-16;23749152;Laura;"Liesbeth and Bert were welcoming and accommodating hosts.
The house was beautiful, clean and well furnished.
The location is maybe not so closed to the center but a free ferry takes us to central station so it was ok.
Big plus of the flat: the terrace when the sun is up! 
We will definitely come back!"
8233245;85311455;2016-07-11;80280717;Michael;Liesbeth and Bert were great and accommodating hosts, they even had a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us.  We were very happy with the apartment, it was clean, well-furnished, and in a good location. It's in a quiet residential area with supermarkets and restaurants very nearby.  The only thing misleading to us was the 1 and a half baths, which is not the case. The shower is upstairs and the toilet is downstairs.  Overall, we would definitely stay here again if given the chance.
8233245;97693805;2016-08-28;58873294;Antoine;"Great house, everything is made to feel at home. We were 2 couples discovering Amsterdam, and the house has made our trip even better. Liesbeth and her husband are really thoughtful and comprehensive. 
The town center is easily accessible by walk with the boat, and even easier by bike. The multicultural district is quiet, and enjoyable to go through.
Nothing negative about this apartment, I really hope to come back in."
8233245;108453188;2016-10-16;34167781;Jan;"The apartment was very nice and clean in a very nice neighbourhood. Everything you need is around the corner and the city center is a just a 15-20 min walk away. 
Lisbeth was a super friendly and a very helpful host. We didn't miss anything. 
The complimentary red wine was a nice touch. Thanks. We would definitely come back and recommend it to those who want to have an excellent time in Amsterdam."
8233245;125368059;2017-01-05;108129727;Amina Emir;Wir waren 3 nächte, alles super gerne wieder. Lisbeth und ihr mann waren super nett, das appartement war auch super. Nah von der central station und dem stadtzentrum.

8301683;49916073;2015-10-07;43998833;Emily;"We felt extremely welcome when we arrived but unfortunately we only got to meet Kevin and not Rosa. 
The apartment was even better than we had expected, with all home luxuries and appliances.
 
Rosa and Kevin had even written out details about the area, including our transport options, restaurant suggestions and options for bicycle hire which was all really helpful and totally unexpected. 

We were really close to central Amsterdam but also had the convenience of shops nearby."
8301683;50680329;2015-10-13;34977291;Alessandro;"La casa è molto bella e comoda per quattro persone.
Kevin è stato molto disponibile nel fornirci tutte le soluzioni ed i consigli per goderci al meglio la nostra permanenza in città.
L'appartamento è a circa 15 minuti di bus dalla stazione centrale di Amsterdam, in un quartiere molto bello, con soluzioni per bere qualcosa la sera anche nei paraggi dell'appartamento.
Economico e bellissimo!"
8301683;52334455;2015-10-28;10130703;Tim;"Great, spaciouse and well located apartment! The hosts were really polite, quick responding and quiet flexible! They gave really useful recommendations and offered us to use almost everything(kitchen, spices, laundry machine, etc).

I would definitely recommend them!"
8301683;53347317;2015-11-08;43321400;Kaan;It was good. Everything was perfect, thank you for all them.
8301683;53766266;2015-11-12;22401927;Pepe;Rosa and Kevin are helpful, friendly people. We had a problem with the wifi but It was fixed easily. It had all the basic amenities for a great visit in Amsterdam.
13921126;125880244;2017-01-08;39382435;Ran;The apartment was great, and the location is awesome!
13921126;133393614;2017-02-22;104123315;Alona;"Our review won't be very accurate, since we were relocated to another property due to some issues with the booking. Even though it might sounds scary, but the whole experience was wonderful. Everybody can make a mistake, but what counts- it's how you fix it. We were offered a same great place, maybe even better value, and our whole trip was as amazing as expected. Good to know that you can relay on your host in good or in bad :)
Beautiful 2 bedroom, 1.5 bath condo, fully loaded with everything you might need. Strong WiFi. Beds were comfortable, and we all loved the blankets! Kitchen had everything, 2 fridges.. we had breakfast every day at our condo. Heating system very easy to navigate. We loved the canal view. Location is great, walking distance to public transportation, as well as to the city center and main attractions (15 min).  We asked if we can check in earlier since we flew in at noon, and they were able to accommodate us - that was great, and gave us opportunity to catch up an awesome walking tour the same day. 
Great job, guys! We would love to come back!

766179;21658022;2014-10-21;2715606;Olle;"Marielouise was the perfect host. Her home is beautiful, clean and cosy. The bedroom on the third floor had a nice view of the back yard. Beds were comfortable and the room had lots of charm.

The breakfast salon in the ground floor was spacious and every morning we enjoyed tea or coffee offered by our host with sandwiches from the bakery across the street.

The house has an excellent location by the Prinsengracht canal. It's nice and quiet, but just a couple of blocks away there are plenty of restaurants and nightlife. The tram stops just outside.

I couldn't imagine a better stay whilst in Amsterdam. Thank you Marielouise for a great stay."
766179;101232529;2016-09-12;51933746;Brian;"Cent Adam is a beautiful home and I found it to be exactly as described. Marielouise is a beautiful host who welcomes you and immediately makes you feel at home. 

The location is perfect for exploring Amsterdam and has the gorgeous Vondelpark on its doorstep for those who enjoy a run in the mornings or evenings ..."

12483001;87900854;2016-07-22;47485343;Claire;"I traveled to Amsterdam with my long-time partner...and we couldn't have been more pleased with Jeanne's attic loft. We didn't want to leave!
As you can see in the pictures, it's a very spacious loft with a couch, TV, dining table, small kitchen, shower, twin day-bed and partitioned queen bed. The private bathroom was one flight down.
Original art by Jeanne's husband, Hans, adds a really lovely touch.
And the Greece-inspired paint job was swoon-worthy. This was perfect for a romantic getaway - we didn't want to leave!
Jeanne and Hans were also fantastic hosts. They were very communicative and made themselves totally available to us, whatever the need. As we were staying there during some of the hottest days of the year, they provided us a fan halfway through the stay. And when my partner lost his cell phone they helped us navigate the local police department to file a report.
All in all we felt totally autonomous but well cared for during our stay. If I ever make it back to Amsterdam I will DEFINITELY be staying with Jeanne and Hans again."
9308904;62272949;2016-02-13;55450530;Fiona;Excellent communication with host.
9308904;63079204;2016-02-20;27904149;Daniel;The place was nice and comfortable- also well located. My main concern was the wifi, which was really poor. Also, I never met Naomi, only the IamBnb team, which were very helpful. However the family photo is deceptive and given the size of the place it is obvious a family couldn't live there. Besides that my stay was great! Thanks.
9308904;99744727;2016-09-05;68414459;Andrew;The apartment is managed by Iambnb, who were great to deal with - we were a bit late arriving so the agent met us with the keys as we had lunch at a canal-side bar around the corner. We met Naomi and Joost briefly and they were very welcoming, but we didn't need to bother them for anything during our two night stay because the apartment was beatifully clean and comfortable. The area was lovely - not central but a quiet areas with with plenty of restaurants and shops close by and an easy 20-30 minute walk to the city centre and museums. We'd definitely stay again.
9308904;102971628;2016-09-19;28931203;Katarzyna;The flat is beautiful and has everything you will need for a short stay. Also location in great - close to trams and magnificent Amsterdam canals, we really enjoyed. The only inconvenience was our arrival - the host wasn't waiting for us at Naomi's place and we had to wait for her around 30 mins outside, even though we confirmed our arrival time several times. Also, when we entered the flat the apartment wasn't completely cleaned and we had to wait to have it fixed, which again - wasn't really convenient and we lost a lot of time because of it. Other then that, I would recommend the flat.
9308904;110578944;2016-10-27;3185531;Itchie;Beautiful place. Very clean and comfortable. Very nice hosts. Would definitely stay again.
9308904;110875832;2016-10-29;11505964;Fiona;Lovely hosts, kind, helpful and flexible when it came to meeting as we had a delayed flight. The apartment was just as it was described and was super cosy, clean, centrally located, perfect access to transport and had great wifi and a TV.
9308904;111708275;2016-11-01;19662066;Marine;"Appartement très propre, mignon, à côté d'un canal et d'un arrêt de tramway allant dans le centre ville. Proche des grands musées à pieds. Possible d'aller dans le bas du centre ville à pieds (en 30min) et 1heure pour rejoindre la gare a pieds. Mention spéciale pour tous les petits plus ""comme à la maison"" : bière, café, cotons, gâteaux, bougies.."
9308904;115032350;2016-11-21;1656987;Alice;Ce studio est un bon endroit pour profiter d'Amsterdam quelques jours. On sent qu'une attention particulière a été portée à la décoration. Le lit est très confortable. Bonne situation par rapport aux transports, quartier agréable et calme. Nous avons communiqué avec Iambnb qui s'occupe de nous informer et nous accueillir, sans aucun souci. Je n'avais pas fait attention, mais à noter, il n'y a pas de plaques de cuisson, juste un micro-onde.
9308904;125884216;2017-01-08;9239294;Anne-Catherine;Studio joliment décoré et calme. Malgré une situation plutôt excentrée, présence de commerces, restaurants et accès aux transports publics à proximité.
4820483;30933720;2015-04-29;28981392;Margarita;The place is in the great location, close to everything! Perfect for King's Day! The room is very nice with big and comfortable bed! Jelle was very quick to answer my questions and they even gave us an umbrella when it was raining, so we didn't have to buy one and carry it back on a plane. It was pretty quiet at night, so even though you are in the city center, you can get a good night sleep... one thing about the sleep... there is a church across the street which plays bell  music every half hour day and night.. we got used to it (after all we live near the church as well), but it was quite a surprise for us in the beginning.
4820483;37877416;2015-07-11;35590232;Puneet;The accommodation was exactly as displayed on Airbnb, Jelle & Lise were very nice and helpful hosts! I would definitely recommend this room to anyone wishing to stay very close to Dam center!
4820483;44795746;2015-08-29;23856126;Janet;The neighbourhood was busy enough to feel like we  were in the centre without being noisy enough to keep us up at night. It's in a perfect location, with all major attractions being no more than 20 minutes walk away! We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! The room had everything we needed, and is right next door to a bakery, making breakfast easy to sort out before a busy day of sight seeing. When we arrived, our hosts took our bags, we had a chat and they gave us a map (which proved invaluable!). Would definitely stay here again!
4820483;45792846;2015-09-06;38110201;Rachel;The room was exactly as described. A terrific location, right next to a tram stop, walking distance to several historical sites, shopping, and wonderful restaurants. Lise and Jelle had several unexpected amenities available like ear plugs and hot tea. The only downside you could find is the church bells do continue all night, but it did not bother us significantly. My husband and I highly recommend staying here, and would do so again if in Amsterdam.
4820483;48382453;2015-09-26;36013798;Jerry;"We enjoyed the ""Tulip Room"" offered by Lisa & Jelle. The location in central Amsterdam is perfect. The tram and bus is located right outside the front door of the flat, so taking off to see the sights was very simple. The street they are located on is not half a block between two canals. Next door there is a bakery and coffee shop and next to that is a grocery with lots of take away foods and drinks. The restaurant with Indian cuisine just down the street was one of our favorites. The Anne Frank House is just across the street behind the church and the red light district is merely a couple tram stops away. The room itself was very clean and opened up to a nice patio to allow more light in. There was a small table with a coffee maker  and a very small refrigerator in the corner. The ensuite toilet and shower were clean and well lit. I would recommend this accommodation to travelers looking for an easy location to enjoy Amsterdam."
4820483;50190619;2015-10-10;16974641;Dan;I enjoyed my stay at Lisa & Jelle's place. Check in was easy and they provided a very nice greeting along with some orientation and suggestions for my visit. The tulip room is very clean and comfortable. I really appreciated the small fridge and dishes provided. The location is excellent for a visit to Amsterdam as it is very central and in an interesting neighborhood. I would recommend it!
4820483;57408301;2015-12-25;51741410;Sandy;Excellent location and lovely neighbourhood! The room has its own private bathroom and entrance. The design and many details of the room are full of little surprises. Even though the room is located on a busy street, it is very quiet. I only  met Jelle this time when I visited. Yet Jelle is very helpful and gave a lot of useful information on the first day I arrived. The room even has a coffee machine with sweet guidance of how to use the machine by the side. I stayed myself this time but I am thinking about coming back again with my partner to stay again! Thank you for providing such amazing staying experience for me! :) xx
4820483;60024291;2016-01-18;10349;Robert;Lise and Jelle were excellent hosts providing a great reception and lots of information about the area. The flat is very central with great access to all the transport and lovely canals in Amsterdam. There's a fridge and coffee/tea making facilities. It's next door to a supermarket and amongst many restaurants and  bars. Great place and great value.
4820483;68442141;2016-04-05;61655457;Chiara;Ottima posizione,dieci minuti a piedi da piazza Dam,si trova proprio di fronte alla casa di Anna Frank. Fermata del tram proprio davanti a casa.Stanza spaziosa,pulita e fornita di tutto il necessario!Bella accoglienza,l'host è stato disponibile e ci ha subito fornito le informazioni principali per visitare la città!  Sicuramente se tornerò ad Amsterdam prenoterò di nuovo questa stanza!
4820483;87307231;2016-07-19;2523447;Brittany;Great stay in the Tulip Room. Lise and jelle were very responsive and also had a spare converter or adapter for us since ours broke, so that was extremely helpful. Location was perfect!
4820483;97826128;2016-08-28;67258602;Einar;"We had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam in the Tulip room. 
The location is really center and we walked everywhere we needed to go.
The church bells are annoying at first but we go used to them fairly quickly and ear plugs were also provided.
Also the coffee machine came in handy.
Overall we had a good stay and would recommend this room to our friends.
Thanks!"

4820483;110248816;2016-10-25;50282566;Mikael;Lise & Jelle are amazing hosts. The room is beautiful, welcoming and super clean. You can visit the whole city on foot, it's really well located, just beside a canal, restaurants, coffee's, etc. They came during the week to change the towels and ask if we needed anything. Wifi works great, bed is huge and super comfortable. There's even a small Terrasse if you want some fresh air. Five stars ! Thank you very much :)
4820483;116640173;2016-12-02;105001768;Stefanie;perfect location in the city. you can reach everything by walking.  the room is quiet and the bed is very comfortable.
4820483;133008475;2017-02-20;23589561;Kevan;"The Tulip Room was the perfect home base to explore Amsterdam from. It was tidy, charming and wonderfully comfortable after a long day exploring the local neighbourhoods. Our hosts were excellent and made sure we were well settled. Made it all a very relaxing trip beginning to end. 

Highly recommend: if you are looking for the perfect place in the heart of Amsterdam's historic canals, choose the Tulip Room!"
9673184;67415191;2016-03-29;24857430;Rebecca;Sophie was friendly and helpful, quick to reply to messages, and her flat was lovely. We particarly loved the neighbourhood and the bar on the corner, the area was laid back and picturesque but only a few minutes walk from the centre of the city
6541993;39947935;2015-07-27;25406298;Lisa;"Jaap's home is a 3 bedroom ground floor flat (with a basement - 2 levels) 1 room has a double bed, one room has a single and there is a baby crib in the 3rd.
It is situated in Indische Burrt - 10 min cycle or 5 mins on the 22 bus from central station. There are cool bars such as studio K, Volks Hotel, the Pumphouse and Badhuis 5 mins walk away and 2 'herbal' cafes a short walk away if that is your thing! Jaap's home is comfy, cosy and very quiet at night - well stocked with kitchen gadgets, toilet roll etc and has a lovely patio and garden. The 2 cats are very cute and easy to care for. We had a comfortable and fun stay in our party of husband, wife and sister having a weekend break and this would also be the ideal place for a family as Jaap clearly has a small baby and an older child so is well set up for this with toys and baby bath etc.
We would definitely stay again"

L'appartement situé au 4ème étage avec un escalier raide est spacieux et lumineux. Nous avons pu découvrir Amsterdam à pied, les trams ne sont pas très loin.
PS : Attention les toilettes sont petits, peut être pas fait pour les grands."

Beautifully designed, the apartment covers all the top standards for a luxury stay and more. It's spotless.  Location is fantastic. When I travel I love to experience a place as a local, and not be a 'tourist'. And be close to everything. bingo! Martijn is a great host! So we were lucky to meet him in person. He is very nice, gentle and courteous. Definitely we would recommend this place to everyone. We loved it, it was nice set up an close to everything. We fell in love in Amsterdam.

L'appartement est bien plus grand qu'il n'y parait : le salon/salle à manger est vraiment très lumineux et agréable. La vue sur le canal est très appréciable :) La chambre donne de l'autre côté de l'immeuble et est donc au calme.
On trouve à l'angle de la rue un supermarché (avec une grande sélection de bières), des restaurants très bien notés pour bruncher ou diner et le centre ville est accessible à pied.
Excellent séjour à Amsterdam !"

It is spacious with high ceiling, wooden floors, old doors and windows. It's very close to the center and everything is in walking distance. 
Can't say anything else then: Perfect"
7284214;40026637;2015-07-27;23014790;Anders;Reinier was kind enough to wait for our arrival as we were half an hour late due to traffic. When we arrived he was friendly, showed us the apartment, and then he hat a nice cool bottle of white wine ready for us + tips for where to go, depending on our wishes. (He even printed a map :) ) the apartment was very nice, perfect and matched the description 100%. I would recommend the apartment and also reinier for everybody going to Amsterdam. 10/10

995124;24928726;2015-01-04;6306836;Alexey;Emile is a great host. Never had such an experience before as living on boat, there was many pro and con within our team especially because of winter time and some domestic reasons. But we satisfied finally, each. Was a pleasure to celebrate new year eve in such unusual place. Its around the same fellings if you rent small equipped cottage at the village, but it has its own nice features. It was charming to have two days of pitching in storm and fall asleep with waves beating on the trim. Very romantic and authentic like in voyage. We also took some fantastic photoes on boat. I would like to thank Emile for that chance. Come and visit us in St Petersburg someday!
995124;35663046;2015-06-21;9372839;Cristina;"We have been a party of 6 , 4 adults and 2 teenagers. We arrived in 2 separate groups. The family from the US by plane and we from Germany by car. The boat is located in one of the harbor areas but very easy to find. It is a big, typical coastal sailing boat, which is still going to sail according to Emile, our host. The cabins and beds are well suited for the 6 of us. The interior of the boat is nicely decorated and the kitchen is well equipped. The location of the boat is ideal. It is very quiet at night, a bakery, a supermarket and a couple of pubs are located within 5-10 minutes walking distance.  It can happen that you are invited by some locals for their birthday party... the boat the tram nr. 10 needs 10 minutes to the city center.
From the island of
Emile as a host is a nice young man who takes the role of a host pretty serious but is flexible. We have called him 1 hour in advance of our arrival time and he was there to wait for us on time.
All together the 2 nights on the boat and in Amsterdam have been a special experience for us, especially for our 2 American teenagers.
We can recommend Emile and his boat 100%"
995124;62429605;2016-02-14;13927301;Claire;"We had a great and enjoyable time at the boat. There was enough space for our family (2 adults and 3 kids). The sleeping space is comfortable, the living/dining area is huge ; the fully functioning kitchen, the nice decoration, the music system, etc, makes this boat feel just like at home ! Emile and her mother who welcomed us are very nice and easy going. We would book again! 
Nous avons passé un super séjour sur le bateau d'Emile. Il y a assez de place pour une famille avec 3 grands enfants. Les espaces chambres sont confortables, l'espace de vie est assez vaste, la cuisine bien équipée et fonctionnelle, la déco est agréable, et il y a une bonne installation audio : on se sent chez soi ! Emile est à l'écoute en cas de besoin et sa maman nous a gentiment accueillis. Bref, nous reviendrons ;-)"

Everything was ok, nice boat, excelent host, he had beers for us like a welcome gift, so was too nice. Would go there again.
995124;88967758;2016-07-26;7544679;Patrice;We spent 3 days on this lovely boat from 23rd to 26th July 2016. Emile's mum, Jeanette, checked us in and out. She was really lovely and very helpful, providing us with good tips on transport, where to shop and what to do. The boat is anchored towards the end of KNCM Island, which is famous for it's architecture. We also enjoyed looking at all the other boats on our 8 minute stroll to and from the bus stop (from central station, bus nr 48 towards Borneo Island). The tram also stops there, which brings you right into the centre (Leidseplein square, 10 min, and from there you can walk right through the center). Our 4 children also enjoyed swimming right off the boat.The boat was very comfortable, with all necessary ameneties. Furthermore, the kitchen has a great little coffee machine (Nespresso), milk frother, microwave, kettle, toaster and dish washer. The bathroom worked well for us, as it was more spacious than we expected. The boat is so peaceful, light and pretty, we'll definately try to stay there again. Thx Jeanette and Emile.

Im Kühlschrank gab es für uns Bier und Wein, die Emile für uns als Willkommensgruß organisiert hatte.  Die Ausstattung des Bootes und die Lage an der Levantkade - abseits der lebhaften Altstadt war einwandfrei.  Wir haben die Ruhe am Abend genossen.  Wir würden gerne wiederkommen.

Great kitchen and plenty of space in the living room. Liselotte and her boyfriend were lovely and very helpful - they gave us lots of good tips and left us a bottle of champagne and a well stocked kitchen. Would strongly recommend to anyone planning a trip to Amsterdam!
1582512;11550684;2014-04-07;8975375;Alice;"A really charming and stylish apartment, it made us feel really good in Amsterdam. The area is really good, a bit aside from the very touristic and noisy center, but with everything you need near: supermarket, bar, restaurant, tram.. You can reach the center of Amsterdam (the canals and the Red light district for example) on foot if you like to walk, or easily by tram in few minutes.
The communication with Liselotte was very easy and friendly. I warmly recommend her place, and would definitely come back here if possible for my next stay in Amsterdam!"

Also, Liselotte and Dick were very friendly and helped us with a lot of information about where to go/what to do. Next time I visit Amsterdam, for sure I'll check if the apartament is available to my stay."

It is a great flat with lots of character. We felt welcome with the fridge full with groceries for a breakfast and Dick also gave our friend a bottle of wine to celebrate her birthday. Would stay again and highly recommend!
1582512;30529992;2015-04-23;17998943;Louise;Had a lovely stay.  Lots of useful notes on the area.  Only issue was the key to the front door took a while to open on our first try.  We found a gentle wiggle helped and lots of patience.
1582512;32426318;2015-05-17;33143756;Arnaud;Thanks a lot Liselotte and Dick !! My friend and I had a really nice stay there. The appartment was exactly as described in the picture well decorated and really comfortable. Dick gave us really nice advices on what to do in Amsterdam and typical places to eat, we even had a bottle of wine as a present ! to sum up it was an awesome stay, I really recommend !!!
1582512;53635936;2015-11-10;47412384;Kevin;We really enjoyed our stay at Lot & Dick's place. This is a very cozy and warm apartment with plenty of space for two people. Our hosts kindly provided some food for breakfast and also some drinks which was very nice. The apartment is also in a prime location right beside the Vondelpark and if you want to go downtown, the #1 tram stops right outside the house. Perfect!
1582512;53970663;2015-11-15;5749545;Jon;Good location near Vondelpark and tram stops right outside to get to / from airport and head central. Clean apartment with everything you'd need for your stay. Nice welcome note with bottle of wine and chocolates. Good recommendations for places to go in the neighbourhood. Stairs are quite steep which is common for properties in this area. Really enjoyed our stay at Lot & Dick's!
1582512;54877257;2015-11-25;46825819;Lee;The apartment was everything that we had hoped for our 5 day visit to Amsterdam. This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a real home from home for us and it was nice to stay somewhere with a personality. It had everything we needed and was very convenient for the centre. There is a tram stop right outside but we walked most days through the vondelpark which is right next to the apartment, about 15 minutes to the museum area, about 45 minutes to central station. Any keen runners will enjoy going for a run in vondelpark as well. There were plenty of restaurants  in the area, we can recommend buuf which is next door. There is a nice craft beer place just down the road (craft and draft) and another one (golllems) closer to the end of the street. There is also a supermarket in short walking distance if you are eating at the apartment. Whilst we did not meet Lot and Dick, they left us easy to follow instructions of how to get to the apartment from the airport and had also left us information about the apartment, local amenities and things to do in the city centre and their communication with us by email was very good. They also left some beer, wine, chocolate and some food for breakfast which was a very nice thing to do and was much appreciated. We would be very happy to stay at this apartment when we come back to Amsterdam.
1582512;92144416;2016-08-07;43343556;Matthias;"Very nice apartment with a good situation! Lot is very friendly and taked time to explain us some goods things to do! 
Everything was perfect, except the shower who doesn't work very well.
Thanks"
2573783;17882733;2014-08-18;6565940;Marjorie;"Ewoud was very welcoming with us. He took the time to pick us at airport and to introduce his house. Moreover, he  explained us lots of details about city (he even  printed the best of list of the best restaurants, cafes, bars....) it was very nice to discover the city! The house was clean, friendly, spacious, nice neighborhood, funtional and it feels like home. (his cat was here and it was funny). 
The house  is very well located. It is close to the city centre, mainly if you rent a bike. We highly recommend this apartment for a stay in Amsterdam! Thanks for all!"
2573783;30329695;2015-04-20;28732564;Clare;My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful weekend at Ewoud and Aimee's home. They were the perfect hosts, leaving helpful information about cool things to do in the local area and beyond and beers in the fridge to welcome us. Their place is beautiful and in such a great neighbourhood, also convenient for exploring the centre of town. We will definitely be back! And I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends, especially couples with small children.
2573783;47174112;2015-09-16;7415635;Yvo;"This is a lovely house right in the middle of one of the most beautiful areas of Amsterdam (De Pijp). I stayed at Ewoud's place for a week and quite enjoyed it. The bed was comfortable and big, bathroom clean and fresh, kitchen full of everything I needed, and overall the place is just really well taken care of and cosy, I felt right at home. The house is in a quiet street but a supermarket (Albert Heijn) and all sorts of shops and bars are just around the corner, as is tram 4 which takes you right to the center of town. Ewoud even let me borrow his bike for the week to get around.

Although I stayed here alone, the house is perfect for families as well."
3169338;23891234;2014-12-14;13032264;Lory;"L'appartamento è situato in una delle strade più famose di Amsterdam per il suo mercato, aperto dalla mattina al pomeriggio, nel quale puoi trovare tutto quello che cerchi, dai generi alimentari ai souvenirs (molto più convenienti dei negozietti del centro); a 10 min dal centro della città utilizzando le linee 16 o 24 dei tram. La casa era pulita, calda e accogliente, proprio come nelle foto. Siamo stati accolti da un caro amico di Karine, simpatico e sorridente. Ci siamo sentiti subito a casa e contiamo di tornarci presto."
6934517;93904270;2016-08-14;12846563;Thomas Et Marie;Charlotte is a great host, she made us feel very comfortable in her apartment immediately! The flat is situated close to a shopping center and to tram stops that go directly to Amsterdam center and the museum area. In particular, there are only few stops to the lovely Jordaan quarter. We had a great time there, highly recommended!
7259667;44576807;2015-08-27;40725831;Bénédicte;"nous avons été bien accueillis par Lois qui nous attendait à notre arrivée
elle a pris le temps de bien nous expliqué les lieux et le quartier, les possibilités pour se rendre au centre d'amsterdam (1200m du ferry)
l'appartement comporte des escaliers très raides mais nous étions prévenus, le point faible est le passage obligatoire par la chambre principale pour se rendre aux toilettes"
14437530;95829558;2016-08-21;41087958;Vincent;Our stay was wonderful and Roel was the perfect host. He was there on arrival even though it was late and the flat was perfectly clean and functional (nothing missing, Roel even stocked some bier for us in the fridge). The perfect experience with RBnB!
14437530;132781557;2017-02-19;22444127;Nick;Excellent apartment. Lovely location and very well arranged check in. For the price this would be hard to beat!
16800577;134180063;2017-02-26;99002836;Su;Good, nice and very comfortable studio near Amsterdam centre. It's has everything you need at your stay. Supermarket is a block away, downstairs it has a little restaurant open at late hours. Jordaan district has many vary restaurants, Thai, Japanese, grills, holland traditional food and also museums and attractions near. I definitely recommend this place to stay.
12413106;85917827;2016-07-14;222126;Bertrand;All perfect!!! Thanks Annette!!
12413106;86126073;2016-07-15;371987;Talon;"We have stayed in a LOT of Airbnb places over the last almost 5 years, and this one is very high up on the list. Annette was great at communication and very helpful with local suggestions. The houseboat is really cool, and she has seriously considered everything one might want or need. There are even a bunch of board games. The kitchen was the best equipped Airbnb place we've ever had. She even thought of little things. 

It's a super comfortable stay in a great location. Close to everything but still out of the tourist zone. We had a family of ducks, some other waterfowl, and a family of swans visit us when the door facing the water was open.

Wifi was reliable and fast.

Highly recommend this place to anyone considering a stay in Amsterdam."
12413106;89136259;2016-07-27;83873741;Albena;Anettes houseboat is very lovely. There is definitely enough space for 4 people. Especially the location of it is perfect (very close to the centrum but quiet enough). She even left us butter, bread, ham and other stuff for breakfast. Alltogether I would recommend this houseboat to everyone.
3974283;19696696;2014-09-16;5890644;Dorée;Jenny was an excellent host - she was quick to respond to our queries before and during our stay and made us feel very welcome in her apartment. The apartment itself was lovely, clean and modern with a pretty balcony, and a perfect size for the two of us. It was a pleasant 20 minute walk to the RAI and there were plenty of shops, restaurants and transport links nearby. A wonderful stay!
3974283;65526453;2016-03-15;26643376;Liza;"We had a great time at Jenny's place. The apartment was warm and cozy, very clean, with well equipped kitchen. 
Jenny's brother were waiting for us in the apartment, gave us explanation regarding the place and recommendations related to the neighborhood. Our communication was perfect, worries-free.
The place is very conveniently located, short walk to the local shopping, bars, restaurants and the great market. Easy walking distance to the Museum Quarter and Center. It was great to live like locals, not in the middle of tourist chaos, yet pretty close to everything. Convenient trams and buses to everywhere - are just next block.
We enjoyed the place a lot, would love to book it again in the future and recommend to our friends."
203658;57280880;2015-12-24;5324545;Rob;"Flawless experience in Amsterdam! Very comfartable and large apartment in one of the best areas of Amsterdam.Central, but safe and quiet.Lots of nice restaurants and boutiques in the neighborhood.
Public transportation is only  a minuta away, but if you got a car it's even possible to park nearby.
Eelco responds very quickly and accurate to any question you might have.If you are looking for an apartment in Amsterdam, this is the place to be !"
10239290;59664877;2016-01-13;9609548;Stefanie;"I had a really good experience with renting the appartment from Scott. He replied very fast and gave clear instructions about the appartment. Everything went very smooth. Also the appartment was very clean and looked like on the pictures. I stayed there with two friends and there was room enough. The only thing that you have to take into account that if you sleep on the sofa, which is also a bed, you hear all the noise from the street. So I suggest to bring your ear pluggs ;-)
I liked the neighbourhood, very friendly people and supermarket Albert Heyn was next door. There are also a few restaurants and also the tram / bus stop is only 5 minutes walk distance.
I really recommend this place!"
10239290;61927414;2016-02-09;55594307;Katie;The flat is tidy, lovely and very spacious. It actually looked prettier and bigger than in the description! The host was very friendly and welcoming in explaining all the facilities and attractions nearby. He even got bike rental discount codes for us! We had a great time in Amsterdam.
10239290;69473450;2016-04-11;14790052;Philipp;Nice accommodation, carefully furnished and kept clean. Apartment is on the ground floor, located in a nice reaidential area. Supermarket almost next door, cute cafes and bars nearby. Quiet neighborhood but still walking distance from the center. Key pickup at the main station came in handy! We would stay here again on our next visit. Thanks.
10239290;88532562;2016-07-24;4855768;Julie;"Not recommended...

First of all the flat is a street lever boutique converted into à flat. Stuck in between a supermarket and and a greengrocer be sure to be awaken by the delivery trucks and the greengrocer himself installing his front shop shelves from 7am to 10am, yelling at his wife in the back of the shop... A glass dumpster is also situated in front of the apartment on the other side of the street.

The apartment is fine, although the humidity stains and smell is not really nice. The convertible sofa is way more confortable than the bed which I found way too soft (personal opinion though!). 
The shower wall mounted shower bar and mixing valve were broken. Shower rug was all wet and sticky, it must have been there for weeks, unwashed...
Sheet and towels were all clean and ok though.
The patio/garden is simply a joke...

Scott who was supposed to be a"" professional host believing in sharing homes"" was everything but that. We haven't seen him once during our stay. He was the least accommodating host I ever (not) met. Asking us 20€ extra fees if we were willing to collect the key once our train arrived around 10pm... Hopefully we were visiting a friend of mine who was kind enough to sneak out of work to go and get the key during the afternoon (from 3pm to 6pm only... very convenient indeed!). 

Well this rental was clearly the opposite of what airbnb is supposed to be. Very disappointed."
10239290;99507296;2016-09-05;15723138;Nicolas;"really nice and located place
no problem to get into the flat"
10239290;106458717;2016-10-06;42991771;George;"We had a great time in Scott's house. The area is very convenient and the place is ideal for 4 people. We were cycling throught the city in very short time. The apartment was not exactly as it shown, since a light interior renovation is needed, but everything worked proper. Its at a good area between the center and many parks. Communication with Scott was easy as responds very quicly. The morning hours that the guest must leave the apartment is a little difficult, especially if you travel later in the day like us.
We had a great time and we will definetely visit Amsterdam again."
10239290;116145504;2016-11-28;92031227;Ely;Tres belle appartement tres agréable et très bien situé !! Le quartier où nous étions est Super proximité de plusieurs commerce et les habitants sont super !! Hôte très agréable merci Scott
10239290;130656224;2017-02-07;108606;Katie;The location is great. The setup is super sparse, so be prepared to bring or buy the very basics, such as hand soap, hand towel or washcloth and a light for the stove. It was not worth bothering Scott about since it was easier to just buy the items ourselves rather than email back and forth, but I'd recommend coming prepared. For this reason I feel like we overpaid, although I understand the location holds the majority of the value. Otherwise the linens were clean and Scott was very easy to communicate with.
7195166;40815081;2015-08-02;38827157;Elena;"El apartamento es muy bonito,moderno,practico y acogedor.Tiene una terracita que da al canal muy util,sobre todo para fumadores. Su situacion es bastante accesible al centro y hay servicios cercanos de supermercado,autobus y tranvia,asi como bares y tiendas.
No es un apartamento de alquiler habitual,se nota q esta habitado y eso le da calidez.
El propietario se preocupo de enviar a alguien para recibirnos y nos ofrecio informacion tanto por mail,como manuscrita,como por telefono.
Una muy agradable estancia.....como en casa."
7195166;50490445;2015-10-12;7539645;Steve;We had a really nice weekend in Jelles Apartment! Late-checkin was no problem and we could also check-out ver late. The apartment is more than beautiful, such an amazing view over the canal. I definitely recommens this apartment and hope to be back soon.
7195166;111173850;2016-10-30;3597905;Louise;The apartment was even more beautiful than the pictures. The view is so relaxing! Everything was working well and Jelle was very gentle and helpful. The apartment is close to the Center and it's very easy to arrive walking.
13459049;86584666;2016-07-17;28245739;Frederic;Appartement impeccable, bien équipé, bien situé (à proximité du centre, à une rue du marché, beaucoup de restaurants , proche du supermarché, proche des grands musées) et au calme...bref idéal pour un couple. Accueil et communication sans problème avec les propriétaires. Nous le recommandons vraiment. Merci Minne !
13459049;87454966;2016-07-20;2067051;Kay;Minne was very helpful and answered very quickly. She was not there to welcome us but arranged for someone to meet us. The apartment is situated in a great neighbourhood, with cafes and shops just around the corner, 15 minutes direct from Central Station and near the beautiful canals. We enjoyed our stay very much as it was very quiet and rather comfy. The only thing to note is that the wash basin is only in the kitchen (none in the bathroom), which can be uncomfortable for some> For us it was fine and we had a great time.

522471;37067236;2015-07-04;34055593;Doug;The welcome information was excellent. It told us everything we needed to know and more. The apartment was extremely spacious and airy and had everything we needed as a family of 4.
529174;11005609;2014-03-17;11608802;Joseph;Christian did a good job being our host. He went over the entire property with me and seemed to never be less than an hour away if something went wrong (day 1 a few circuits tripped and he was there to fix the problem in 15 minutes).  Would definitely rent from Christian again as this property very comfortably fit my group of 14.  Also the location could not have been more amazing. Thanks again Christian.
529174;20416889;2014-09-29;18583964;Ane;Verten møtte oss ved ankomst og viste oss leiligheten. Han var meget hyggelig og gav oss tips om nabolaget og Amsterdam generelt. Leiligheten var veldig fin, og perfekt for oss jentene. Den var akkurat som beskrevet i annonsen. Nabolaget var helt supert, kort avstand til shopping, barer, restauranter, severdigheter etc., det perfekte nabolaget. Neste gang jeg er i Amsterdam er dette så absolutt en leilighet jeg ville booket igjen. En flott langweekend i en super leilighet!
529174;27408000;2015-03-03;17302874;Nitesh;"Christian is an amazing host. The house is beautifully built. It is honestly a place one should choose. He was so helpful with everything and was instantly available on the shortest notice. We were a group of 12 and we all enjoyed it a lot. Definitely in an area/locality worth living. Again the most cooperative host we've met.
Way to go!"
529174;34690322;2015-06-11;17945301;Rosemary;"We enjoyed our rental in Amsterdam. The location is great! A favorite activity was to sit on the little balcony and watch the boats, people and bikes go by. The beds are comfortable. It was a great experience to stay in a “real’ canal home. We rented all three apartments for our group of ten and had more than enough room. 

The stairs are steep, but they have good strong handrails, which helps. Just a note - there is a full steep staircase to get to the first apartment and for each level going up. I was told that there is a very small short staircase to the first apartment. I have bad Knees, but could handle it with the good handrails. Just staying in this home was a fun experience! The one thing that was inconvenient was that we had to walk 10 minutes to a location where we were to leave our garbage. 

When we arrived, we were met by Felix and he asked for a 250 Euro deposit that I was not aware of. We received it back on the last night but had a hard time reaching him. Even with these inconveniences, I am glad we stayed here and would recommend it."
529174;38262225;2015-07-14;30534880;Alper;"First time with Airbnb. We were 12 friends celebrating our 50th birthday. The house was exactly as advertised with 6 comfortable rooms and 3 bathrooms. Actually 4 people more can sleep on the comfortable sofas. Outstanding location, right at the corner looking at a canal and a bridge, minutes walking to all attractions and bars and restaurants. Only thing you should know is the very very steep stairs, which were like ladders leaning on a wall. I understand that steep stairs are typical for the historic homes in Amsterdam. Our house had a tiny balcony, then we realized that it was a big privilege. It was great to sit, sip drinks and watch the action on the streets and the canal during sunset hours. There are 2 large well equipped kitchen/living areas. We used only one. There is a small cafe in front of the house which was great to have a morning coffee and breakfast. We can't think of a better place to stay in Amsterdam as a big group. It was a big plus to enjoy beautiful Amsterdam. 

Check-in and check-out was very smooth.

We needed a voucher with our names on it for visa purposes, but we never received a response."
529174;53453621;2015-11-09;28612606;Vedat;It was a nice experience for us and everyrhing was great, very nice location clean towels and beautiful wiew
529174;57626350;2015-12-28;42081535;Garen;It was interesting to know that Christian had actually lived there as a child.  He was very informative about the parking and the expense it was.  He gave great insight as to places to eat and times to get to certain venues so you did not have to wait in large lines (Anna Frank House) He saved us at least 2 hours.
529174;97645479;2016-08-28;3822069;Hadi;Apartment was big enough for our group of 3 couples.  Went in summer, no AC which was tough.  Location and keyless entry were great.  Furniture needs an update, and maybe some bigger fans. Good for large groups.
13722751;113513677;2016-11-13;27595782;Cenk;If you want to stay in a very nice place in Amsterdam, with a very kind host and want to see how a host must be, you should stay in her place. Every second we have consumed in her place was great. Thanks!
3129198;18442332;2014-08-26;14603472;Rachel;The apartment was lovely and cosy and we especially enjoyed watching movies on the huge sofa with the fire blazing.  Klaas has really interesting design features and artwork throughout and everything you'd need in the kitchen.  The apartment is very well located in a quiet and smart area and easily walkable to the tourist spots.  Klaas was very easy going about check in and out times and made the process really easy for us.  It was nice having the outside space in the middle of the flat and the bedroom was nice and dark for sleeping.  The only thing that would have been slightly better is one mattress instead of two joined together however the bed was still very comfortable.
3129198;22556198;2014-11-09;20393440;Uri;"The apartment is exactly as described, clean, warm and nice.
Internet works well.
Communication with host was quick and accurate.
Warmly recommended."
3129198;47461278;2015-09-19;11657567;Robert;Klaas's apartment has a lot going for it.  The neighborhood (Jordaan) is our favorite area of Amsterdam with many small boutiques, restaurants, cafes etc.  You can easily walk (or even better bike!) to any attraction in Amsterdam.  Klaas's decoration of the apartment is really high end.  It feels more like a boutique hotel with all of the photography and quirky touches.  The king sized bed was really great after touring Amsterdam all day and the large shower was much better than other apartments we have had in Amsterdam.  Lastly communicating with Klaas before and during the rental was fantastic.  He was super quick to respond to all questions and when we had a minor issue during our stay he was able to fix it right away with prompt communication.  If you want to stay in Jordaan this apartment is hard to beat unless you really up the budget.

Safinaz and her family are very very nice people. every starts from the delicious breakfast cooked by safinaz. she can cook Italian and Egypt and Netherlands food....a great woman.. i can feel their happiness , which make my travel more happy...
593101;15690149;2014-07-14;6037786;Laurent;In the neighborhood I wanted, walking distance from the station. This was a nice stay for me.
593101;29067773;2015-04-03;29711784;Alan;Safinaz is an exceptional host. She is more like part of the family. Although, we did have trouble trying to get to her to accept help with dishes. She went out of her way to prepare breakfasts made with love for us. She enjoys cooking, so we had dinners prepared by her.  We enjoyed chatting with her, listening to her stories and telling our own. The location is perfect for a visit to Amsterdam, easy walking distance from the central railway station or two tram stops.  Would definitely stay with her next time we go back to Amsterdam. …. We would go back to Amsterdam just to stay with her… Pauline and Alan

Safinaz is such a warm host with full of hospitality. I was particularly touched by her special tea set and tasty breakfast.
The location is within walking distance with many attractions, and you can enjoy many beautiful street sights here and there on the way to city center."

593101;105910168;2016-10-03;123710;Joan-Marie;We were delighted wth our reception, Safinez kept a look out for us as we  arrived at night, and even after staying in about 15 Airbnbs in Europe and the US,  we have never been greeted with the array of snacks, fruit, minted water, tea, coffee, electric tea pot, I could go on, in our room. Safinez  made breakfasts for us and accomodated to some very late ones, and couldn't have been more gracious and helpful in assisting us in getting around the city. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, and feel like I made a new friend. I love AIrbnb!
593101;108241283;2016-10-15;77052121;Stefan;Safinaz war eine sehr nette und zuvorkommende Gastgeberin. Sie hat wirklich alles getan, um meinen Aufenthalt so schön wie möglich zu gestalten, mir jeden Morgen ein Frühstück zu jeder benötigten Uhrzeit bereitet und immer gut gelaunt. Ich habe unsere Unterhaltungen bei einer Tasse heißem Tee genossen und nebenbei noch viel gelernt.
593101;127975937;2017-01-22;5985653;Anne;Safinaz was very kind, friendly and helpful during our short stay. She was generous with providing food and drink. The room was spacious clean and comfortable.

She prepared a lot of food for us and cooked breakfast every morning, the breakfast is so delicious and sumptuous, even better than most restaurants!

12500365;124638164;2017-01-02;58468608;Tiffany;This was an awesome stay! I didn't even want to leave the houseboat most of the time. Yvette was friendly and made sure we had all of the things that we needed to have a great time and be comfortable.
12500365;130791316;2017-02-08;54626869;Igor';Место в тихом районе , неподалёку олимпийский стадион , атмосфера спортивного городка , много зелени вокруг , из окна открывается спокойный вид на канал с утками и лебедями . Отличное место отдохнуть  от городской суеты . Фото соответствует действительности. Спасибо Yvette , За Ее Класный дом
12500365;139636613;2017-03-26;42341304;Angela;A gorgeous houseboat with everything you need. Had a lovely weekend here and Yvette is so helpful and lovely. Can't wait to come back one day soon x
1170370;9168346;2013-12-10;6010486;Annabelle;"We had a wonderful stay in this appartment. It is cute, clean and full of character. Lovely view over the canal and very central so within easy walking distance of the central station which we found very handy. Asdis and her family are lovely. Would definitely recommened staying here. 
PS. Only thing we weren't crazy about was the bed because it is very soft but that's just personal preference."
1170370;33646502;2015-05-31;11875537;Miguel Jose;"A really beautiful apartment, very confortable and really well equiped.
The sight of the canal is incredible, the neighbourhood is very quiet and you are close to everything in the city.
Asdis and her family are very kind and the music they play is amazing.
I really recommend the apartment, no doubt of it."
1170370;33998619;2015-06-03;30781023;Susan;This house is truly stunning, as advertised. Actually, even better than advertised. The room is spacious, well furnished and comfortable. There are so many good restaurants in the area that we didn't eat at home except for some sandwiches, but the kitchen facilities would have worked for cooking a meal. The bathroom was lovely and included a washing machine, which was great because we had been traveling and needed clean clothes. The location is extremely comvenient -  one metro stop from the central station and the neighborhood is great. The hosts were gracious and helpful. This is a true Amesterdam house with narrow and steep stairs so if your suitcase is heavy you need to be in good shape to get it up the stairs.  We hope to stay here next time we are in Amsterdam
1170370;34397976;2015-06-08;21957731;Nancy;"My husband and I loved our stay at Asdis's studio apartment on Oudeschans, overlooking a beautiful canal.  The apartment was lovely and quiet, as advertised a spacious studio with private kitchen facilities and bathroom, and everything was left clean and tidy for us.  Asdis was incredibly welcoming and kind, the location was terrific (walking distance from the canal boats, Rembrandt House, the beautiful Portuguese Synagogue and Jewish Museum, and excellent restaurants), and the view was exceptional; in short, everything was as pictured.  Asdis recommended a great local soup place, Soup en zo, after our long journey, in addition to inviting us for tea and coffee.  She was exceptionally kind and generous, letting us leave our bags with her after we left.  We loved hearing occasion snippets of classical music, and the violin bow-maker on the ground floor was welcoming, as was Asdis's husband Mick. Highly recommended!"
1170370;39198752;2015-07-21;35910248;Ryla;This was a great place to stay! It was a short walk to restaurants and and scenic views.  It was about a 25 minute walk to the museum area. We loved having access to a mini fridge, washer dryer, and little kitchen.  Great place to stay!
1170370;57196417;2015-12-23;36180940;Naomi;We just loved this place. It looked exactly like the photos on the website. A perfect spot to explore wonderful Amsterdam. The room is beautiful. It was set at a perfect temperature (we had arrived from Adelaide where it was a very hot 44 degrees) it was lovely and cosy. Our hosts greeted us and were always prompt with their responses. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone.
1170370;61900087;2016-02-09;47632416;Laura;"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Asdis' beautiful apartment. Easily in walking distance to all you could want to see and do in Amsterdam, it was a great base for our relaxing weekend away. The hosts were great, even when we were delayed in our expected arrival time, and were easily contactable when necessary whilst still giving us total privacy during our stay. 
We wholeheartedly recommend a stay here!"
1170370;73240457;2016-05-07;22626481;Nathália;"Everything was perfect at Asis' house. The location, the comfort and the space in general. I would definitively come back!!! 

Tudo foi perfeito na casa da Asis. A localização, o conforto e o espaço da casa. Eu com certeza retornaria!!!"
1170370;81415879;2016-06-22;8934286;Jeanne;Absolutely wonderful stay! The place was cozy, quaint, clean, and had huge windows with a stunning view. I spent more time in the apartment than I thought I would, because it was so relaxing and beautiful. I loved listening to the classical music being played downstairs. The amenities were perfect, as I saved money by being able to cook for myself and do laundry in the apartment. Close to everything without being in a busy neighborhood.  It was very quiet, and I slept so well! Addis was welcoming and helpful. Definitely would stay there again.
1170370;82638813;2016-06-28;44802704;Steve;Wonderful place in a very convenient location. We very much enjoyed our stay.
1170370;85864118;2016-07-13;46884232;Aaron;BEST AIR BNB EVER! If you are looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam you should definitely stay here. We booked this place based on reviews and it exceeded every expectation. Im convinced there is no better way to enjoy the city. The location is close to where everything is happening but in a quiet area. It was amazing. The room was better than pictured, very clean, and spacious.
1170370;101919157;2016-09-15;24292436;Emily;We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Amsterdam- and we saw the entire city. The room is beautiful overlooking the Oudeschans. It's in the middle of everything but just outside the craziness, making it a perfect spot. The studio itself is beautifully remodeled and entirely functional amenities. Asdis was a wonderful host, extremely nice and even let us in early when our flight arrived early. We plan to come back and send some referrals!
1170370;127154297;2017-01-16;40273491;Dagmar;"We cannot imagine that there is a better place to become acquainted with this wonderful city: a cosy apartment in the third floor of a sentimental old Grachten-house, comfortable and practicably fitted, with a fascinating view on the Gracht, centrally located, with connection to all kinds of public transports and a supermarket in the radius of 200 m. Very helpfull and nice hosts! Thank you, Asdis! We want to come back as soon as possible!

1170370;133861839;2017-02-25;15100867;Michael;Beautiful apartment in an awesome building. We loved the location. Easy to walk everywhere. The apartment was clean, spacious, renovated kitchen and bathroom, comfy bed, and had a great view. Location was optimal and quiet which we wanted. Asdis was so easy to communicate with and super friendly from beginning to end. Highly recommend this apartment.
1170370;138894423;2017-03-22;4019230;Rachael;"The apartment was clean and close to the center of the city! Everyone we encountered that lives in the building was kind and helpful.

The only negative that someone may have with this particular apartment is noise. I believe a children's school is nearby, which makes the area loud when they are walking to and from classes. Additionally, the owner is a cellist and can be heard practicing throughout the day. We enjoyed the music but others may not."

Would stay here again any time."
3809292;23191995;2014-11-24;23618143;Lora;"Merel and her boyfriend Alex greeting us on Saturday morning when we arrived.  The flat is great and in a perfect location for exploring.  Merel's neighbourhood is great loaded with trendy shops and cafe's and is only about 20 walk into the centre of town.  There is a tram located outside her front door.  The flat is great and really quiet.
Merel went out of her way giving us maps and loads of tips of places to go and things to do and see.
Great experience overall."
3809292;23722265;2014-12-08;24235706;Katherine;"Merel met us at the apartment and was extremely flexible about timings as we kept getting mixed up with trains so were late.
The apartment is very easy to find and in a great area, plenty of bars and quality places to eat. The supermarket just below was very convenient. 
We were made very welcome and Merel had even got us a card for our anniversary which was lovely. We were shown around and made to feel very at home. The apartment itself was lovely, really stylish and cosy, ideal for a couples retreat and we felt so relaxed that on one of the days we didn't venture far at all! The breakfast items and coffee machine were a very welcome part of the stay.
The apartment is not right in the centre but we enjoyed being a bit out of town as it was nice to come back to a more chilled part of town and it wasn't far to walk. The market is a nice way to spend an afternoon on the Saturday and I would recommend a Thai restaurant called Siriphon which was one road up.
It was our first time using this site and our first experience couldn't have gone any better. Thank you so much Merel."
2134950;14060175;2014-06-10;7531203;Peri;"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in Ernsts und Marilenes Appartement! Es entspricht absolut der Beschreibung,ist sehr ruhig und enorm zentral (URL HIDDEN) ist hell und wirklich sehr gemütlich und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. W-Lan funktioniert perfekt. Wir haben uns Fahrräder gemietet und man muss nur um die Ecke biegen, um in der Prinsengracht und dann auch schnell in den anderen Grachten zu sein.
Außerdem sind Ernst und Marlene wirklich ausgesprochen nette Vermieter, die uns bei einem Tee alle Fragen beantwortet haben. Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder!"
2134950;19733601;2014-09-17;17215338;Matthias;Very nice and clean Apartement. It was a perfect stay in that lovely City.
2134950;48686342;2015-09-28;21325228;Ragnvald;"This one is all what is promised! Cosy - and top floor! After two steep and narrow stair flights (- as elsewhere in Amsterdam!), the bright one-room apartment opens up. A lot of small windows lets a lot of light in. Two single sleeps on the open ""loft"" up the ladder, one double bed at main floor. 
The neighborhood, although it's central, is very quiet all night and all day.
The kitchen is not much more than a workbench (it actually IS one - very cool!) in the corner. You can always ""plane"" some eggs for breakfast, but breakfast and dinner is best left for the many good restaurants and cafés in the neighborhood. There's also a microwave oven and a small fridge around. 
Bathroom/wc is small but new. 
Nothing misses. Everything is clean.
The host, which is living nearby, was very welcoming and was very helpful throughout our stay, - easy to ask and quick on returning SMSes.
We'd visit Ernst and his wife again!"
2134950;74545563;2016-05-15;16000998;Heike;Ernst and his wife are very friendly  and helpful hosts which gave us a warm welcome. They provided the room with good things for daily use (refrigerator, tea, coffee...) The apartment itself is nice, clean, lovely decorated and very well located, central and in a quiet street. You can go nearly everywhere by foot. Thank you very much for your kind hospitality!
2134950;94866096;2016-08-17;88966513;Muyun;The host was very nice and approachable and helpful. Place was neat and organized as described and shown in the picture. I would like to stay there again if I am going to Amsterdam later!
2134950;116942356;2016-12-04;51887042;Jovan;"The place is just out of the busiest city center. It's great for tourists who would like to enjoy Amsterdam but also be able to hide and take some rest. 
The home is a true Amsterdam-like building, will give you sense of how life works here."
325165;4183171;2013-04-16;5160234;Kate;It was great staying in Janneke's apartment, very clean, small but comfortable, perfect for two people. It was surprisingly close to the center of Amsterdam- about a 30 minute walk and plenty of public transport nearby. Many shops, bars and supermarkets close by. We really enjoyed our stay in such a cute apartment.
9131858;87793789;2016-07-21;26700452;Jenny;Julia's place was beautiful and very clean. The place is in a quiet neighborhood but close to the city center and to a metro. We loved the cats and would definitely stay here again.
8024854;80053110;2016-06-15;67831236;Stephanie;We had a fantastic time at Rochelle and Thijs' place. It was the perfect base for our first trip to Amsterdam. The apartment was very comfortable, very well appointed, and close to shops, bars, restaurants and transport. The communication with Rochelle and Thijs was easy, and they always replied promptly. I would definitely recommend this apartment and hosts!!
8024854;100948564;2016-09-11;24823539;Lanny;"The place is a per what being described. Clean and spacious for 3-4 person to stay. Nearby with foods, Marts and tram. Difficulty is on the steps in getting our luggage up and down. 

Worry free in getting your apartment key as Jackets is now few steps away from the tram. Also host is very kind in getting you prepare with introduction to you on Amsterdam. Almost all information you need is there."
8024854;140178440;2017-03-28;80957284;Ahsan;The flat is amazing. You have everything there to kick start your holiday, all necessities from small to big are provided which is great. very spacious ideal for 3-4max. nice view from balcony and in 15-20 mins you can reach all to the hustle and bustle of the city.
1921050;30391364;2015-04-21;17209268;Ismene;We had a really good time in Amsterdam. Max's House is perfect located in the middle of it. Our room was clean and the bed really confortable!The guys were friendly and avaible if they needed to be helpful but we had a lot of privacy!Thank you guys for the nice stay!
8382934;54036273;2015-11-15;24922859;Josepfh;"Amazing vacation in the heart of Amsterdam.

I had a great time at sherry's place, it is as described and the pics were accurate, it is located right in the heart of the centre where all the fun is at, but quite enough to get a restful night sleep. The host is very welcoming and informative who met me on arrival "" thanks for being there early truly appreciated"". Beats a hotel any day.

I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to this beautiful city."

16732229;133266351;2017-02-21;116365392;Nick;Very convenient position for all the activities that Amsterdam has to offer. We walked from the station which took 15 minutes and it was easy to find. Great views of the canal from the apartment. Steep stairs maybe a problem for the elderly or the very young. Walter was great. We even got BBC 1 and BBC 2 on the box.
1266433;9070091;2013-12-04;9382089;Letizia;"That's a really good experience: welcoming environment, great location and amazing place to stay in Amsterdam! 
""The Library"" is almost like an apartment, with own entrance, bathroom and backyard, the only difference being lovely and friendly hosts upstair. The privacy is respected. The room is very clean and well equipped. The neighbourhood is quiet and great next to the local hotspots. 
I highly recommend staying ""The Library"" if you want relax and comfort in a cozy apartment after exploring the awsome City!"
1266433;10551318;2014-02-24;1928129;Andreea;"Perfect room for a couple ! we only stayed there 2 days, but we could have spent a week or more because the location is great, in an awesome area (quiet, clean, with lots of shops and restaurants and art galleries nearby, not far from the musems). The room was very clean and nice and cosy. The only thing we kind of regreted is that it didn't have a view on the canal, which you can see by the way just outside the main entrance however.
Sander and his nephew Lex were great with providing us all sorts of information and allowing us to leave our luggage outside the ""normal"" hours so that we can enjoy the city.
A great experience that I would strongly recommend !"
1266433;11890585;2014-04-18;12908779;Francisco;"We were traveling with my wife across Europe and of course Amsterdam was a place that we could not skip, and we are glad we didn't, what a romantic and fun place, you can cruise the canal area, go to amazing museums and in the same day go to a bar or coffeshop and have the time of your life.
""The Library"", what an amazing and cozy place in the heart of Amsterdam, awesome location at walk distance to all the places you will like to see, with everything you will need in it, with a very nice patio and an awesome book and specially comic book collection. In summary the place was exactly what the description said and more.
Marijke and Sander were awesome hosts, and a very nice couple! they made us a very nice and useful introduction were they marked down the places we could not miss due to the short time we had, and were ready to attend every question or concern that we had.
When I'm coming back to Amsterdam (and I will) I'll stay at ""The Library"" again for sure!"
1266433;12686765;2014-05-08;5702969;Anne;"Thanks to Sander and Marijke we had a fantastik stay in Amsterdam.  These guys know their city and they always gave us very good and helpful advise.
""The Library"" is located on a very beautiful canal and is in a very cool (yet quiet) neighbourhood."
1266433;19325669;2014-09-10;5489006;Dennis & RJ;"Great location! Very easy to get to from the airport and the property is right by the canal.

We didn't  meet our host, as they were out of town but their friend welcomed us. Sander was very quick to respond and had a list of suggestions. Highly would recommend! Loved our short stay."

help understanding Amsterdam, ways around the place, sights to see,
eating spots, and the Dutch outlook. I would go back if I visited the
city again."
1266433;22074927;2014-10-29;969135;Catherine;"Sander & Marijke are extremely welcoming and friendly hosts who want to make sure their guests have a good experience visiting Amsterdam. When we arrived they asked about our interests and oriented us to our location and various highlights of the central city with a very useful map of the area. Their tips on where to do what helped us to make the most of our short time in the city. They also gave us good recommendations on nearby restaurants. The ""Library"" is downstairs from and at the back of Sander & Marijke's living quarters, so it is very quiet and private. The bed is extremely comfortable, the lovely windows let in a lot of light, and everything is immaculately clean. Finally, the location of this Airbnb is wonderful--right on one of the canals, and within walking distance of most major attractions. And though restaurants and shopping are within a block or two, the street itself is quiet. Highly recommended!"

We were welcomed with some hot tea/coffee while they shared with us tips of places and great restaurants they love around the city. The library itself was cosy, clean and very comfortable, with an amazing collection of books like other guests have mentioned. It's in the perfect location and you can walk to literally everywhere in the city. Would highly recommend to stay here!
1266433;23947680;2014-12-15;19740038;Helen;"We had a wonderful time staying at The Library. Sander and Marjike were very helpful and incredibly warm and friendly. Upon arrival we were greeted with wine and snacks while being shown the attractions and local amenities on a useful map. While very friendly, our hosts were respectful of our privacy, too.
 
The apartment itself is clean, cosy, and nice and warm. A coffee machine, kettle and fridge were provided and we did not find ourselves wanting for anything except perhaps some more time to explore Amsterdam. We would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone."

As a Museum and concert goer I could not have found a better location. Walking distance to all the key Museums and so grateful to Sabine for the extra time and assistance she gave me...I would never stay anywhere else!!!
214576;10260672;2014-02-10;10664026;Kristin;"Staying at Sabine's was my first experience with Airbnb and set the bar really high; I loved her place!
When I arrived, Sabine had the apartment clean and well appointed.  She had many maps and books about the area and quickly set about showing me how the town was laid out.  I really appreciated that because it helped better orient me right away.  She had breakfast food set out in thw kitchen and gave me great food rec's for the area.
The second day I was there I got sick and Sabine made sure to get me to an Apothecary so I could get medicine right away.  
She and her family were very warm and inviting and between that, the location and the way the aprtment was set up, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with her and would highly reccomend it to anyone.Thanks Sabine!"

Ses conseils, son enthousiasme, sa connaissance de l'histoire nous ont conquis et que dire de la chambre tout tout en haut de la maison... Il ne faut pas être trop fatigué pour monter chez soi!

922441;49682148;2015-10-05;1891852;Thomas;Unfortunately we did not have the chance to meet Bart in person, as he was on holiday during our one week stay. Instead we were greeted by his friend Maarten, who was very friendly and waited for us in the apartment even though we arrived as late as 11 PM. Maarten showed us everything we needed to know about Bart's apartment and Amsterdam in general, and was available for contact as Bart was not present. Bart's apartment is located in De Pijp, which is an interesting area with many shops, cafes and restaurants. The street the apartment it located in is quiet and nice, and it also feels more like the real Amsterdam than the more tourist crowded areas in the city centre. The city centre is within walking/biking distance, although the tram stops a few hundred meters from the apartment if you want to save some time. There are many walking routes to the city centre, for instance you can walk through the Sarphatipark, the Museum Quarter, or along the main road which is the shortest and fastest route. This way you won`t get tired of walking the same route many times, and you get to see different parts of Amsterdam. The apartment itself was very nice, with everything that a home should have. The bathroom is a bit small, and the apartment should maybe been equipped with more lighting, as it was a bit dark. But all in all, Bart's apartment was a perfect base for our great trip to Amsterdam, and we would definitely stay there again.
922441;58407665;2016-01-02;10263205;Elsie;"I fell in love with Pijp after being here. It has a low key vibe with a lot to offer. A short walk north you run into Albert Cuyp and some really great food options. We enjoy a lot of walking so we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see in Amsterdam from this location - Anne Frank house, museums, red light district, central station, Rembrandtplein, Leidseplein.

Bart was a friendly host and communication was easy. He was very chill, which made it for a very relaxing stay for us. He provided everything we needed. The shower water pressure was good, bed was comfy, and the surround sound speakers within the apt was def a plus. Thanks, Bart!"
6848342;43304575;2015-08-18;3031181;Don;Anneke's apartment is large and very beautiful - and just as described in the description. The location is excellent and she was very kind and informative upon arrival.
6848342;49102225;2015-10-01;5200760;Kristin;Anneke's apartment was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. Communication was easy and seamless leading up to check-in and during our stay. The space is light and bright as seen in photos, and we enjoyed using the full kitchen to prepare meals. The apartment location is on a charming street in Helmersbuurt and close to lots of great restaurants and bars, Vondelpark and the Museum district. I would recommend Anneke's apartment!
6848342;52448374;2015-10-29;5637801;Derek;Great location. The nice little apartment looks exactly as pictured in the photos. Anneke was very flexible and accommodating to our late arrival, gave us a few good recommendations of places to eat in the area, and was nearby if we needed anything. Overall a good experience.
6848342;66516197;2016-03-23;5114719;Katherine;The apartment was exactly as described and shown in the pictures. The location is fantastic and I would definitely recommend this apartment to others. Anneke was an excellent host and responded promptly to all enquiries.
6848342;68885141;2016-04-07;58937742;Tracy;"I highly recommend this property and would book it again!
It was my first visit to Amsterdam, and this apartment was a perfect combination of location, comfort and restfulness; it was a very welcome oasis after a busy day touring the sights. 
Anneke kept in touch prior to my arrival, greeted me and gave me a friendly tour of the apartment when I arrived. She made me feel quite at home and the bottle of wine and lovely tulips were a very nice touch.  
The apartment was exactly as presented in the listing, it was very spacious with high ceilings and large windows, and was a great value compared to the typically small hotel rooms in Amsterdam. It had everything I needed, including a great Krups coffee maker that I made good use of! The apartment was spotlessly clean and felt light and airy. It was very quiet, no traffic noise (sometimes I could hear the neighbour walking upstairs, but it wasn't disturbing and there was no noise at all late at night), and even had a cute little balcony off the bedroom that got some evening sun.
It's on a quiet residential street, but quite close to public transport plus there are several cafes and grocery stores nearby, all within a couple of blocks. Easy walking distance to the museums (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh, Stedelijk), shopping in the Nine Streets, and handy access to multiple tram lines that take you into the centre of Amsterdam (only about 12 minutes  by tram, or a 30-minute walk).
It's a hip neighbourhood, and felt very safe even when out alone at night. 
This experience has made me an Airbnb believer! Thank you again for your hospitality, Anneke!"
6848342;69580839;2016-04-11;5675952;Angie;"Anneke has been a great host to us, accommodating our early arrival and luggage storage requests to the best of her abilities. She is very friendly and provided assistance with navigating and suggestions for restaurants around the area.

The apartment is very clean and looks just as featured in the photos. I would definitely recommend this place to future visitors."

(Near to vondelpark, the museums and leidseplein.)
It´s a bright and clean appartment and in a quiet neighbourhood. 
Great experience!"
6848342;77930468;2016-06-04;16648476;Maggie;Anneke was a great host. She is attentive, friendly and very responsive. She gave us lots of advice on restaurants & shops around the area. The little guest booklet in the flat is a gem. Great recommendations on food and transport. The flat itself is very spacious and cozy. It's within walking distance to bus & tram station, supermarkets and restaurants, yet it's a quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. There was a minor incident during our stay but Anneke was quick to resolve the issue. We are very happy with our stay.
6848342;78888598;2016-06-09;63001566;Maria;Wow, Anneke was such a great host. She made my friend and I feel welcome before we even arrived at her beautiful apartment. She kept in contact with me before our stay and even allowed us to check in early as our flight landed early, that was so helpful! She gave us helpful tips about Amsterdam and places to go. The apartment was unbelievable. I was blown away by the cleanliness, the decor, and the amenities. And it was in a great location, outside of the center but close enough for walking. We felt very safe and comfortable at the place. Anneke was nice enough as well to call us a cab to the airport when we left. If I'm fortunate enough to go back to Amsterdam again I would love to stay with Anneke again, best experience ever! Thank you!
6848342;82512000;2016-06-27;5485851;Russell;"While staying at Anneke's apartment, a song kept playing in my head:

Cat Stevens
INTO WHITE
(URL HIDDEN)

After an exhausting day touring a fast-paced Amsterdam, jumping between the bells of the streetcars and the dings of the bicycles, the apartment simply emptied everything into white, so quiet and calm and elegant that we immediately felt relieved and peaceful. 

Anneke was a reflection of her apartment. She lived below us, but never bothered us. She only responded - quickly and easily by text - when we needed something. We really loved this, because we want solitude and quiet during vacations.

I was a little concerned about two things when we rented the apartment: wifi and music. The wifi was excellent, and the little radio she has there makes a surprisingly big sound with an iPhone. We were thrilled.

Anneke also allowed us a few perks that were not written into the apartment description. Those privileges made us feel very welcome and at home. 

Thanks, Anneke. If you're ever in Rome again, text me. I will happily give you a bike tour and show you all of our best coffeeshops!

16350016;135934724;2017-03-07;8516015;Nikki;Thank you so much for the warm hospitality. What a wonderful apartment. It is actually better then pictured and the bed is gorgeous. And did I mention the luxurious bath tub and rain shower. What luxury! Have not really missed a kitchen, as I ate out anyway.  I was welcomed with a lovely bottle of wine and brand new tea and coffee amenities. Even got some work done, but also enjoyed the great neighborhood with it’s eclectic range of stores, bars, restaurants, movie theater, museums. A stone's throw from the beautiful park. Very close to everything really. Walked most of it and otherwise used public transport although I rented a bike around the corner. I can full heartedly recommend this gorgeous place. Everything was just perfect. Will be back soon! Thanks again.
7306822;67218423;2016-03-27;29031935;Shan;The host is very kind-hearted! And it is near to metro so it's easy to go city centre!
7306822;69264960;2016-04-10;61500240;Tran;Claudia is nice, flexible and provide you guides.
7306822;73219107;2016-05-07;64723800;Yi;Nice room and a very welcome landlord.  The location is convenient with one bus to central station.  Cozy place to live in Amsterdam.
1180064;5791397;2013-07-16;6994947;Boonrat;Me and my friend had a very nice stay in Amsterdam. The location of the appartment is perfect. From here we could explore all the beautiful areas of the city by foot. The kitchen is full equipted with a big table at the dinning room, also the living room is cozy. All in all very good place to stay! Also the communication with Arne was very nice and easy.
1180064;11798030;2014-04-15;3073631;Elijah;Arne was very very helpful before our stay and during our stay. He is very easy to communicate with and understands a travelers needs. I can recommend his appartment to anybody looking to stay in the centre of Amsterdam and who is looking for a real amsterdam style house to stay in. We walked to all the major attractions in the city, supermarkets are close by, tram stops are close by and lots of cafes are all near his appartment. The appartment is on a quiet street so after a long day you are able to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I can only recommend his appartment.
1180064;11990332;2014-04-21;9745886;Erwin;"Very nice and spacious apartment, fully equipped kitchen, nice dining and living area. Close to everywhere, we've bought the tram day pass but never use it since we can walk to the city center. 
Arne is a great host, he explain us everything we need to know about the apartment, the neighborhood area and also the good tourist attraction we need to visit in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."
1180064;25211513;2015-01-09;22644353;Emily;Arne was a wonderful host, gave us some suggestions for things to do in Amsterdam. Apartment was beautiful and all was as expected!
1180064;39217988;2015-07-21;33143010;Sarah (And Tom);Beautiful apartment in a great location. Arne made us feel really welcome and gave some great tips. The neighbourhood was quiet and cozy 10 mins walk from some nice local bars and restaurants not full of tourists! Centre of the city was also easily accessible by foot or by public transport.
1180064;59953311;2016-01-17;2550926;Alana;Arne was friendly and flexible. Apartment in a good location close to De Pijp and the centre.
1180064;60606870;2016-01-25;20371613;Joe;"Great stay! We chose this place because of the pictures (which really do match reality) and because of all the great reviews it has. We were not disappointed. Arne was very friendly, knowledgeable and laid back about our late arrival and our late departure as there was no one checking in the next day. 

The studio itself is great- it's really spacious and comfortable and was a great place to put your feet up after hours of walking around the city. The location is ideal - I actually thought we'd be taking public transport more but everything was within walking distance of the apartment.

All in all I had a great experience. Thanks again!"
414917;1677224;2012-07-10;1428740;Nikolay;"Apartment is really fantastic. Located on calm street but right in few minutes from the city centre. There you will feel yourself like being local. Rooms are big and comfortable and everything is tidy and clean. Kitchen is equipped with everything you may need and both bathrooms are in excellent condition. 

BUT what is the most important: Jan is the best host we ever seen!! Hospitable, amicable and really helpful!!

Would definitely recommend this apartment to everyone!"
414917;2277192;2012-09-14;513183;Nicolas;The property was in a beautiful part of Amsterdam convenient for the city yet in a lovely quiet area. The apartment itself was very clean and was really lovely with two good sized bedrooms and very modern and well equipped bathrooms. The property also had a beautiful courtyard garden. Jan was a really great host, very helpful and couldn’t do enough to make sure our stay was comfortable. Highly recommended – would definitely come back again
414917;2797863;2012-11-04;2991003;Andrew;"The only complaint my family and I have about our stay at Jan's apartment is that we had to leave. We (my wife and two kids, aged 5 and 9) stayed for four nights and felt so at home my kids were asking when I would find a job in Amsterdam so we could all stay in the neighborhood. Jan was in the apartment when we arrived, and it was a real pleasure meeting him as he took loads of time to show us around the apartment so that we would have an easy, pleasant stay. He even provided some fresh groceries and made sure we had laundry detergent.The apartment itself is beautiful - very well equipped for its size and very comfortable. There were a few toys for the kids, and a Nespresso coffee machine for the grown-ups. The neighborhood is also wonderful - it's one minute to the nearest tram stop, or only 15 minutes' walk to more touristy areas. We were glad to be in a quiet street away from more noisy nightlife, but very close to neighborhood cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. There's also a small playground right outside the apartment, which made the kids really happy.

This was our first time using airbnb place, and I'd find it hard to believe that all their apartment rentals would be as good as this, but our experience with Jan as a host definitely makes us want to use airbnb again. Thanks Jan!"
414917;3914771;2013-03-26;1595448;László;Friendly,clean,RECCOMENDED!Thanks Laszló
414917;5069575;2013-06-10;6691285;Robert;Wonderful location! Quiet, centrally located, near tram stops, restaurants, shops, pubs, and museums. Apartment is clean and well furnished with modern appliances and fixtures, a well appointed kitchen, and a pleasant patio. Highly recommended.
414917;16783982;2014-08-02;17377465;Alan;We had such an amazing week and Jan couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming.  Right from the start where he took the time to show us around the neighbourhood pointing out cafés and restaurants, he made our stay pleasant and and enjoyable.  The apartment itself was perfectly located, close to everything while still being quiet (ideal for a family) and lovely inside.  We're already hoping to be back next year!  Thanks again Jan!
414917;17766189;2014-08-17;6162468;Maryellen;Jan was a wonderful host from the moment we made the reservation, several weeks before our arrival. His answers to our questions were always clear and helpful, and the helfpulness continued once we arrived.  Jan is a natural innkeeper, with an easy manner and an intuitive sense of when to help and when to let visitors be.  The location couldn't be better--beautiful, quiet, and convenient to absolutely everything -- cafes and museums in walking distance and 3 trams just a block away.  The only thing I'd clarify is that the larger room's bed can be separated into two beds, but the smaller room is best suited to a sleeping-together couple.  But again, it was a perfect trip for us and our two girls. Everyone was happy!
414917;24710100;2015-01-02;21777595;Nathalie;"What a wonderful stay at Jan’s place. Jan’s apartment is warm and definitely an excellent place to live !
The localization is perfect : by walking you can go anywhere you want in the city and yet it’s a very quiet place.
But what we prefer concerning Jan’s place, it’s Jan himself. Jan is the kind of guy you fell you have always knew him ! Jan is like an old friend you like to visit.
So it’s very pleasant to live in an apartment you can adopt immediately.
We will be back !!
When we flew back home my little daughter wrote in her hand : I love Amsterdam. I think that it’s a good conclusion for such a successful journey.
Thank you Jan"
392003;7315457;2013-09-15;8591839;Domenico;"Agnes était aimable et la chambre petite mais confortable.
J'était étonné de devoir laisser 100 euro de garantie pour les clés, mais probablement cela dérive de quelque visiteur indélicat qui est parti avec."
392003;23554156;2014-12-04;3054386;Kafi;"Please see my private feedback. 
Agnes is a very pleasant woman. This is in a good location. 
As a host myself, I find it difficult to ever leave a lackluster public review. It takes a lot of hard work to be a good host."
392003;36040120;2015-06-24;34699242;Jeremy;"The lacklustre reviews below are fairly accurate, but if you're not that picky, I suppose the place is fine. 

However, the 100€ deposit for the keys was unexpected and left a bad taste in my mouth. A bit of a last minute booking for me, and certainly not worth the price."
392003;36773723;2015-07-01;29130706;Kathy;Agnes met us upon arrival.  We paid our 100 Euro cash deposit.   She showed us our room which is somewhat similar to the one in the photo.  What you don't expect is that the dresser next to the bed has been changed and not for the good.  The room is the width of the bed and the door into the room cannot open all the way.  The bed is not a double bed.  There is a beach bucket for a trash can.  There is nowhere to hang clothing.  The dark and dingy bathroom had a damp odor and it turned out there were 7 of us sharing it.  There is also a large dog on the premises.  The TV can only be viewed if you stand on the bed.  The bed came apart and the doorknob came off so that we had difficulty leaving the room.  We never were able to find the lights for the hallway.  The water heater must be turned on IN THE KITCHEN before you can shower.  She didn't answer our texts regarding these problems and then accused us of breaking everything and said she'd have to charge us.  Then, when we called AirBnB she said she had already filed an insurance claim for the damages.  This was a terrible experience.  Oh, and did I mention the 'mice?'  I think she actually met 'rats.'  I have photos of the threadbare washcloth, the broken doorknob, and the bed.  Don't make the same mistake we made.  The location is good, but the hotel we got when we moved out only charged 10 Euros more and it included breakfast, a room with two single beds, en suite, a frig, and the doorknob didn't fall off--ever.  I'm giving it 1 star because I can't do minus 5 stars.
392003;68213314;2016-04-03;36429330;Sophia;"My boyfriend and I booked this room very spontaniously because another host cancelled on us. We made the mistake to not see the price difference between one and two people and after booking we couldn't cancel because Agnes wouldn't let us without paying the whole price anyway, so we decided to make the best of it.

As we arrived (yes we arrived one hour late because of the horrible traffic in Amsterdam) Agnes already was not so amused but tried noticably to stay friendly she told us some facts about Amsterdam and explained everything in detail. For example that we payed for the kitchen but weren't allowed to cook there, that we'd have to help to keep the bathroom floor clean though we payed a cleaning fee already, or that we're not allowed to keep food anywhere because of the mice. 
She had plenty of rules and didn't seem flexible at all, she told us that there probably will be other guests but she can't tell yet. 

The room was very small but the size was ok for a couple, the window couldn't be opended, the capet on the floor was dirty and old, the walls and curtains were paperthin so you could hear the street noice and see the street lights shine through at night . She gave us a key to lock the room, but the doors were very old and hard to use.
In the hallway was no light so the appartement was way darker than on the photo. 
The bathroom was not as expected, the lighting was very bad and so was the shower because there was no hot water. Taking a shower meant also to flood the whole bathroom because there was no air condition or window so Agnes told us to use a mop. The sink was always clocked and not nicely cleaned. 
The kitchen was also a disappointment, we couldn't cook, in the fridge it smelled like fish or chicken or something not tasty, and some of the few cutlery was dirty. 
The location of the house is great, near to puplic transport but you can also walk from there and see a lot of the city.

There was a dog in the house Agnes didn't tell us about but we sometimes heard it bark behind a door. The room itself is not at all familyfriendly!

So now to conclude I wouldn't recommend it and I was glad to get out of there after my two day stay. The money you have to pay for a second person and cleaning is not justified and you'd probably find a good hotel for the same price. Yes Amsterdam central is expensive but for this tiny room and that little service even the location can't justify the costs. 
This is not what I want to expect when I book a room on Air BnB."

The place is organized in such way that you dont want to leave it. Even though, if anyone want to go downtown it's pretty easy doing with a bike (included in the price).

This place is where every first timer in amsterdam should stay in. not your first time? even more! forget everything you know and cross the river with the cool free farry (10 min) then walk along the canal for another few and you're home. the barn is magical! late lazy morning and warm nights next to the fire , everyone is super friendly there , Maik , Flu and Donny will help you and explain everything from the closest supermarket , coffeshop , bus station , and any impotrent information you need.
campers are all clean and cozy with all the space for your bags and little heater that do the job perfectly and keep you warm at night!
the free bikes really do the differance , save you a lot of money and makes every go out healty and fun.
best part about this place is how quiet it is at nights , you cant find that anywhere downtown.

100% im going to stay there again! this place is a must!

Now , if you read it till here , scroll up , and BOOK your stay!

much love ,

The entrance of what I now call my fav park in the world is literally across from the bldg. on a beautiful and quiet street that will make you think you're miles away from downtown when in fact it's a 10mins walk to awesome restaurants, can gogh museum, etc. Manon was awesome about everything - she met me at 7:30am given that my flight was so early from US, and was always available on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) anytime we had a question.

I was renting the houseboat bout for 8 days during october 2015.
Firstly I never met Mirjam the real house owner all I got was a contact man how came to welcome us but didn't know anything about the boat reaptly saying I don't know how to unlock this or where is what.
The living room has bad air circulation and the first glass is unmoveable. The second glass has two moveable part the one close to the living room is locked with screw! the owner does not want you to have normal circulation of air in the appartment!
that wasn't all!!!!!
the owner took from me at the reservetion Cleaning fee of 37 Dollars and as we arrived to the houseboat the ""host"" (contact man)  took from us aditional 100 euros guarantee for if we break something. at the end of the trip we CLEANED the houseboat leaving for him only to clean the floor (2 min top) and we didnt clean the dishes (8-10 min) and the wet towels, the ""host"" gave us back only 50 EUROS! saying that we did to much mess! (Nothing was broken) 
I Have photos of how we left the houseboat i would give them to how ever want so you can see what is the definition of the ""host"" for additional 50 euros of cleaning after we already paid 37 dollars for that!
you think its all?
No no no we were 3 people living there before i reserved this houseboat i asked her if the apartment is good for 3 she said of course! i will open an extra bed for you we found out that the extra bad wasn't even a real bed it was hard as hell, small (my feet was out of the bad and part of my hands) and if you slept on it you would wake up with alot of pain! one of us had to sleep on the sofa with was awfull but better then the folding bad.
Still it doesn't end! the owner promised 2 bikes as i arrived and asked the ""host"" where the key's and the bike are he didn't know (like anything else) and only after two days at amsterdam he told me he found where they should be and he can give us them now. after we already rent 3 bikes rather than 1.
to sum up: 
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.

8434745;65035227;2016-03-10;57297466;John;Mirjam made us feel very welcome to her houseboat. She was very friendly and made suggestions of where to eat and visit. The area is lovely, central to the city without being busy, you can truly live like a local. The boat was very well equipped and had lots of storage. South facing it got the sun all day and would be beautiful to visit during the summer months. There is nothing we would change about it and would definately stay again when next visiting the city.
8434745;71342022;2016-04-24;4976916;Steve+Mariana;We loved the houseboat!  Great location and such a nice terrace to relax on.  We even braved some of the cold weather just to sit out with some wine and conversation in this amazing city.  Checking in and out was easy and Mirjam was kind enough to let us drop our bags while she was still preparing the flat for us.  Wonderful place to stay!
8434745;73749586;2016-05-09;53264074;Abigail;Having had the privilege to stay in 5 star hotels in cities throughout the world, the experience staying on the lovely houseboat was one of the best and my husband and I would not consider staying anywhere else when we return to Amsterdam. This was our first time using airbnb and we were not sure how it would be and would now recommend it to anyone. The boat itself was spotlessly clean, the large lounge and kitchen area were perfect and having the outside terrace with all the flowers and comfortable seating was just great. In fact, the passing tour boat passengers were continually taking photographs of what is definitely the prettiest house boat on the canal. Exactly 10 minutes’ walk from Amsterdam Central - we timed it with cases! And less than 5 minutes to Chinatown, Red light and Nieumarkt we had thought it may be quite noisy at night, but it was so peaceful, with just the beautiful clock tower that chimes. Also would recommend visiting Captein & Co the local café bar restaurant, it became our local. To have this amount of space and a view of the centre of Amsterdam if at a hotel would be a huge amount of money. Also our host Mirjam kindly took us on a great boat trip around the canals. Just can’t wait to return
8434745;87540812;2016-07-20;19706340;Corito;Mirjam was very helpful and was there when we arrived to provide info and help.  I also texted her during our stay and she was very helpful.  The houseboat was in a great location - close to alot but still off the beaten path and quiet - lovely  to watch the other boats pass while sitting out on the deck,  the deck was a lifesaver as it was unseasonably hot and it was cooler there.  Place was nice and clean and well equipped.

1299652;30623923;2015-04-25;23080495;Phaethon;Paul was a very helpful and friendly host from the moment he welcomed us till our departure. There were cookies, coffee and other fine goods waiting for us in the kitchen. The apartment was beautiful, clean, spacious with a wonderful backyard which me and my family absolutely enjoyed. It is located in a great neighborhood full of bars, restaurants, cafes and many more. We had a wonderful stay at Paul's place and our vacation was great so I totally recommend it. Thanks Paul!
1299652;31206081;2015-05-03;28212512;Philipp;"Paul was as good of a host as you could wish for! He was not around personally during our visit as he was traveling himself, but even then he was always in contact with me, making sure we had everything we needed and replied to messages extremely quickly (considering he was traveling as well!!). 
His apartment was very nice and clean and everything was prepared well. Our 3rd person had to sleep on the sofa so there was a sheet and pillow there as well.
Long story short: You couldn't wish for a better host!! :)"
1299652;70904083;2016-04-21;13414123;Penny;Paul is an amazing host - he had several excellent recommendations and was very easy to get in touch with when I needed directions/suggestions. The bed was really comfy and the apartment is immaculate...couldn't be in a better location. Amazing restaurants, shopping, coffee shops and the city center all within a short walk. I was a solo traveler for most of this trip and the neighborhood (the whole city, actually) is safe, vibrant and easy to navigate. Definitely my favorite place out of all the places I stayed in Europe.

The beds are really confortable, the kitchen is perfect to have lunch or dinner with family or friends. The location is next to the center by public transport and really quiet by night.
Saskia was really available for us and really fast to answer to messages. 
I absolutely recommend Saskia's house to visit Amsterdam"

Saskia's place isn't located in a very nice area, near to the beautiful Vondel Park.
Her place is nicely decorated, very bright and spacious. Bed is very comfy and the shower is nice.
She even did welcome my friend and I with balloons and wine as she knew it was my birthday.
I highly recommend to stay here ❤
Thanks again Saskia!"

It is very well located: 5/10 minutes of walking from downtown, in a nice and quiet neighborhood. The appartment is large, with nice furniture and accomodations. We are looking forward to go there again !

The pictures and description were accurate. The place is well appointed. 
A couple of things I need to mention:
There is a lively, animated bar restaurant on the ground floor where we enjoyed a beer and a salad on the day of our arrival. Some might find it a little noisy ... I enjoyed the activity. 
The typical narrow staircase may be hard to navigate with regular size suitcase; I was happy I was traveling with a carry-on bag.
Overall a great stay. I would choose to stay at the City Center apartment again in a heartbeat. 
Thank you for hospitality and Aloha, 
Dominique."
732509;95074301;2016-08-18;30063775;Clélia;Nous avons été accueillis par un homme alors que le profil de l'annonce annonçait une femme. Accueil très froid et anonyme. Nous avons eu l'impression d'être entre les mains d'une agence, ce qui n'est pas normalement le profil de ce site. Le logement est bien situé mais la cuisine était sale, les instruments gras:  surtout le logement n'accueille pas du tout 6 personnes: nous étions 5 et l'une d'entre nous a dormi sur un lit d’appoint dans une chambre où les enfants étaient réveillés par la lumière du jour. Enfin l'accès au logement se fait par un  escalier très étroit et très pentu, difficile pour des voyageurs chargés de valises ou pour des personnes d'un certain âge.
16527093;131197289;2017-02-11;3098701;Szymon;Great location between airport and city center. Apartment has a great potential but renovation hasn't been 100% finished yet. The host was extremely friendly and kept me well informed about how to get to the place and how to get around. The room wasn't 100% clean and that is something which needs to be improved.

2047323;31944431;2015-05-12;26364774;Simon;"We stayed in Karin's house for nine nights and enjoyed the house and wider city of Amsterdam immensely.

Our group of four adults (two couples) and four children (aged from 2 to 12) were comfortably accommodated. Beds were clean & comfortable, kitchen was fully stocked and the backyard was great for the kids.

The location was a nice compromise away from the tourist bustle of the CBD, yet only a 5 min walk and 10 min tram ride to be  in the midst of it.

With bikes we explored the nearby parks (Rembrandt, Vondel, Sloter) and the city alike (easy 10 min ride to Central station).

Karin was a very welcoming host and made us all feel at home in her family's lovely house.

We just hope the house stays listed for our next Dutch holiday!

Thanks Karin,

7871078;104364373;2016-09-26;44319539;Elena;Jeen owns a nice and cozy apartment. It was very clean and also just about half an hour walk and a short trip with the ferry away from the city centre. Jeen provided us with enough information about the surrounding area and the city itself before our trip. We enjoyed the stay and would recommend this apartment.
7871078;125334366;2017-01-05;27363024;Sarah;Jeen's little house and location were perfect for my trip, I could have stayed just in the neighbourhood all week. Comfiest bed I've ever slept in, kindest arrival and nice and quiet. Loved jogging along the docks and jumping on a boat each day to the city. The piano is also in good tune!
2427983;58972292;2016-01-05;51691185;Michele;For a Berlin first timer in winter this apartment was perfect. It's well located in a good neighborhood right opposite a train and bus station. You are surrounded by places to buy groceries. There are excellent facilities in the apartment in which to prepare food. Janosch was really helpful in communicating clearly how to get to the apartment and in answering questions. When I made a mistake with my booking he was so helpful, for which I am very grateful! Highly recommended.
2427983;64208406;2016-03-01;8759332;Toms;"We had a great stay in Janosch's place. Although we never met him, everything was organized and maintained. The room was really spacious and light with high ceiling and really large bed. We had a full access to kitchen and bathroom. Everything seemed exactly like in the ad and the room fully met our expectations.
I'd like to point out the location - it's easy to get around with the public transport as the bus stops and underground stations are in a very close proximity. It's possible to actually walk to some of the main areas of central Berlin without using public transport.
The surroundings are rather commercial mixed with various restaurants and fast-food services. There is also a supermarket which is very convenient. Don't expect many hip places in this neighbourhood, yet it feels very lively and central with an easy connection to other city areas.
There is the modernist building New Gallery by Mies Van Der Rohe in 10 minutes walking distance as well as the iconic Shell House, Philharmonic and other pieces of valuable architecture. There is also the Resistance museum and other cultural facilities. In terms of sightseeing - the neighbourhood provides plenty of places. Some of the main Berlin's shopping areas like Kurfürstendamm and Leipziger Platz are very close. I highly recommend this for couples willing to explore the city."
2427983;68547471;2016-04-05;30221512;Santeri;The room and the apartment was really bug, nice and clean! The location is awesome, maybe 50 - 100 meters from the subway station. Different options for eating plus couple kiosks and a nice corner pub in 50 meters from the apartment. Didnt meet janosch in person but was really helpful and answered very fast for the messages.

Only a few minutes from the main train station and a few minutes walk from the Metro and S-Bahn - makes getting around and back very easy. Matthias and his wife greeted us at the apartment, they are very nice people, and had some great tips about where to eat and what to see while we were visiting. 
The apartment is super clean, very well equipped and has literally everything you might need during your stay. With a grocery store downstairs and an organic grocers a few doors down; it was very easy to have all the necessary things to feel at home. There is even a court yard facing balcony which is great to take a morning coffee before heading out to town. Lots of restaurant and cafe options near by make it super easy to find a bite when you're hungry and don't feel like going far.
We were sad to have to leave but hope to come back soon! When I do, I would definitely love to stay with Matthias again - him and his wife were wonderful hosts. 
Vielen Dank!"

The apartment is situated in a vibrant area with lots of cafes and bars nearby but the actual apartment is still quiet. It was very easy to access major tourist sites as the station is very close. Anton was a great host and provided us with lots of useful information for our stay. He was also able to accommodate our flight times for checking in and out which was very helpful. The apartment itself was light and spacious with a very comfortable bed! We would definitely stay here again if we were to go back to Berlin.

11772418;75253464;2016-05-20;64023023;Minh;It was a great experience to spend 3 days on Marcel's room. We felt like home here. Nice location when u can walk for 2 minutes to the metro station. Perfect room and common space. The best thing here is people in this house, Adrian and Roft. We talked, shared many things about Berlin like friends. Adrian even spent time with us walking around Berlin. There is a chance coming back Berlin, I would love to stay more in your apartment.
11772418;99593486;2016-09-05;17739210;Beatriz;The stay in Jokers room was overall very pleasant, the neighborhood is nice, quite different from the rest of berlin, is known as the turkish place, which is awesome for food, specially the food market on tuesdays and fridays. The building is located in an avenue, just in front of the subway station, I expected some noise, but really had no problems at all with that.  The access to the common areas of the house was very easy and I rarely met someone else. Great wifi as well! Don´t think I could find better equation value x money x location x confort ! :)

Lisa is a sweetheart and made me feel right at home helping me get my bearings on how to get around the city as soon as I arrived.

14933760;109094887;2016-10-19;70293148;Christopher;The apartment was clean and as advertised. The room I stayed in felt like I had a studio to myself, with a sofa, a study/computer desk and a balcony! Location was amazing as it was 2 mins walk from the Westend S Bahn station, which made it really convenient. Getting there from Schonefeld Airport was also easy - just take the S Bahn (which is a 4 min walk from the airport terminal). I would recommend others to consider this apartment as well. The host was also really lovely (although I didn't get a chance to meet her) and left me a welcome present in the room! So thoughtful !

Die Beschreibung der Unterkunft entspricht ganz der Realität. Die Wohnung ist sehr interessant und schön und man hat sich wie zu Hause gefühlt. Anna ist eine sehr kommunikative Gastgeberin und hat uns auch Ratschläge gegeben. 

Die Umgebung von Neukölln ist sehr interessant und vielfältig, nicht weit vom Flughafen Schönefeld und auch nicht so weit bis zu den bekanntesten Sehenswürdigkeiten. Mann kann das auch mit dem Fahrrad in einer halben Stunde schaffen. Der in der Nähe liegende Bezirk Kreuzberg ist hervorragend.

Wir können die Unterkunft bei der Annalucia nur empfehlen."

Die Wohnung ist nett und schön, mit Holzfussboden und hohen Decken. Als alleine Reisendem hat mir ein Fernseher gefehlt, der Kühlschrank ist bei Nacht sehr laut, und beim Hinterhaus ist ein bisschen der Lack ab . Dafür ist die Lage der Wohnung wirklich perfekt, nahe an der S-Bahn in einer sonst sehr lebending Gegend, aber sehr ruhig (abgesehen vom Kühlschrank)!"

The location is superb: in the heart of everything like bars, restaurants, cafés, shopping mall, U-Bahn and S-Bahn station (Schönhauser Alle). The apartment is in the ""innenhof"" (an interior patio) and on the ground floor, but very quiet and confortable. You have acesa to a small private guardem. The bed is comfy, styling and big.

Fiel reflejo de las imágenes, un estudio donde nos sentíamos como en casa, bien equipado y muy buen entendimiento con Miriam, que en todo momento estaba dispuesta a aclararnos cualquier duda.

Helena was sadly out of town but we met her lovely neighbour who gave us the keys and showed us around and even wished good luck for the fair.

The room is even better than the photos, very nice and warm with a private bathroom and a shared kitchen decorated with good taste. Everything was clean and tidy.

Helena had given us clear instructions on anything related with our stay, she provided us with bits and bites for breakfast and she even offered us bikes to ride to Messe!

1257781;6179682;2013-08-02;184643;Jill Eid;I had a lovely time in Susans apartment. She is a very sweet person and easy to be around. The room i rented was very nice and comfortable. I sleept like a stone on amazing silk sheets every night.
1257781;37251828;2015-07-05;21845680;Charlotte;"The flat is so quiet that you can almost hear the two cats walk! Susan has a few house rules which are easy to live with. She is discrete, however, on my last evening we found out that we had a lot to talk about so it got rather late..... I would not recommend that flat to people who don't like cats, and whilst I am not a cat person myself, I succombed to the friendly cats. The flat is centrally located for public transport with easy access to the airport,  I even walked home one evening from Mitte. I rented a bicycle around the corner and parked it in the yard. The neighbours were friendly and greet me with a ""hallo""when I crossed them in the yard. Cycling is absolutely the best way to explore Berlin. The shops are not far so I did some shopping for my breakfast but had my other meals outside. The area is lovely with lots of small restaurants and quiet tree lined streets. It felt very safe with playgrounds, bicycles parked in the street and clean surroundings. On Sunday morning people had brunch at small tables, and I even popped into the nearby church where people had been active in the month leading up to the fall of the wall. Berlin is absolutely lovely, and my three nights did not suffice!"

1257781;57596672;2015-12-27;5716019;Axel;Susan is a very nice and friendly person and her cats are very nice too :-) The room is very big and perfectly clean. We did not have time enough to socialise because I was visiting my daughter living in Berlin and I spent most of the time out of the flat, too bad because Susan is very welcoming and an interesting perso to talk to. The flat is very nicely decorated with objects that have an history and with paintings made by your host.

Lot and her family were so accommodating, always quick to respond to questions and an absolute pleasure to deal with. Her personal touches were very much appreciated - on arrival there were 2 bottles of wine, coffee and the most delicious biscuits called stroopwaffles. Thank you Lot for your kindness. It was so relaxing eating breakfast on the Terrace, watching boats sail by almost within touching distance. An experience never to be forgotten. We would highly recommend Lot's Houseboat to anyone wanting to spend time exploring Amsterdam. Its in a great location and there is a Supermarket around the corner.  Public Transport is within a very short walking distance although we preferred to walk along the canals. Happy holidays to anyone staying on this Boat.
1415279;9060197;2013-12-03;3481533;Wayne;"We stayed in Lotje's houseboat for two nights and it was fantastic. Spacious and beautiful, comfortable, on the water. It exceeded our expectations in every way. Lotje's husband gave us some advice and suggested we check out Pijp - listen to him because it's good advice! Hopefully we'll be back for longer one day.

Oh and if you were worried about the house being cold, it's not. It has modern heating and is very comfortable."
1415279;20011806;2014-09-22;6309073;Adi;"the boathouse was perfect for us.  roomy, comfortable, and very sweet.  we spent there four lovely days and found everything we needed.  the location is not in the center of the shopping area but central enough for us and very near to a tram station.  
everything is just like in the pictures, a very special and nice way to visit Amsterdam."
1415279;26055343;2015-02-02;23223812;Moe;"Boathouse was easy to find.  Located in what I consider to be the best neighborhood in Amsterdam.  Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but close enough to tram stops that makes all of Amsterdam a short tram ride away.  Albert Cyup Market is a short walk away along with other grocery stores.  

The property its self was very nice.  We were more impressed with the way things looked in comparison with the photos.  The boathouse did lack privacy curtains on some windows, which made it a little awkward with boats passing by all the time.

The only drawback is the huge difference between the advertised price and the actual price (more 70%).  That said, I still think that it was well worth the money that I paid.  Definitely recommend, especially if your staying for more than 5 nights.  Added bonus if the weather is good."
1415279;53267502;2015-11-07;31427118;Eoin;Lovely comfortable houseboat. Easily accessible to the city and all amenities available. Would stay again.
1415279;62280834;2016-02-13;56201623;Edoardo;"una parola, bellissimo!
ambiente caldo ed accogliente
grazie"
1415279;63705351;2016-02-26;10055333;Kate;"We arrived on time but no one was at the houseboat. The number given in the contact details was switched to mailbox. It would therefore be helpful to give Kwame the caretaker's number as the contact. The location is perfect we were able to access all main sights on foot. We parked our car at the apoca car park only 5 minutes walk from the boat - this costs 42 euros per day.
The houseboat has clean floors but all vertical surfaces are somewhat grubby. Please note : no wood is provided for the wood burning stove - guests are expected to bring their own wood."
1415279;68310096;2016-04-04;51793586;Stacey;What a great way to spend your time in Amsterdam. We had a great time staying at this houseboat and it's in a great location. I loved having the decking outside where you can sit and chill out looking over the canal. The house is equipped with everything you need and I would recommend staying here!
1415279;115857378;2016-11-27;9587058;Nancy;Wonderful experience on a new concept of living. Great kitchen near street market rivaling Paris. Walkable to museum and reasturants and public transport. Will recommend to all friends visiting from UA
1415279;116390681;2016-11-30;4092407;Hannagh & Alex;The boat was fantastic and we will definitely book again soon!
1415279;120545694;2016-12-11;96083538;Philipp;"We had a great stay at Lotje's house boat. Even if we were too early, it was no problem to get into the boat and Kwamwe showed us everything. The boat is at a great location, near the hip-district De Pijp with a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops and even a very nice street market. The central heating is working well and we never felt cold on the boat.
Supermarkets and public transport are just around the corner, really a great spot! Lotje was always very helpful and answering quickly on requests or questions we sent her. After all, it was a very nice stay in Amsterdam and we can only recommend to stay on the house boat, it is a very special experience. We even were allowed to check out late because there were no direct following guests. Thanks again to Lotje for everything!"
1415279;125903151;2017-01-08;58154278;Marc;Such a nice houseboat! I recommend staying there.
582121;4253521;2013-04-22;5327630;Charlotte;"We spent a very nice weekend at Laura’s flat. Her studio is modern, lighting, located in a typical Dutch building in a quiet street, and above all at walking distance from everything. The canal is around the corner and nice stores are located close by.
Laura is also the perfect host! Super nice, available to give us the keys in person, and ready to help any time during our staying. On top of that, she left us a delicate attention and a kind note. 
For all these reasons, we both definitely recommend you to come in her place!"
582121;5605585;2013-07-08;1828461;Jim & Sylvia;Lauras place was perfect for our stay.  Excellent location in a charming section of the city, across the street from a 15th century bar (apparently the oldest in Amsterdam) and easy access to everything.  We loved being able to open the big windows up to view the wonderful street below.  Would definitely stay there again in the future.
582121;11384542;2014-03-31;5753754;Christophe;Great location, near Ann Franck's museum and several attractions. Canals are just few seconds from the apartment. You can walk easily to the center. The apartment is quiet and bright. Laura is reactive and very kind! I recommend this apt for your next stay in Amsterdam!
582121;12112547;2014-04-23;9268584;Svetlana;We absolutely loved our stay at Laura's cozy studio! Laura is a friendly and mindful host, she explained us everything and kindly allowed us to use all the facilities and watch DVD's (there are some really cool old school movies). We especially loved the bed in the wall. The studio is located in a beautiful Jordaan district, right near the canal and Anne Frank House. There are so many great cafes and bars around! It is also close to central railway station, we haven't used public transport at all. I would definitely recommend Laura's studio to other travellers. And we'd love to come back one day. :)
582121;32777687;2015-05-21;32730833;Joao;"Laura was very friendly and the apartment was like I Wait.
We could use all the things of Laura

the street is very calm and near the center of amesterdam.

thank you laura

2581825;12600916;2014-05-05;11639630;Rodrigo;I had a wonderful time at Pilar's apartment in Amsterdam! Pilar is a very nice and kind host and received us with chocolate and wine. All the time she was ready to help and guide us. The apartment is very nice, comfortable and clean, with big windows, creating a very nice atmosphere. The neighborhood is just awesome, very beautiful and safe area, full of flowers, arts and amazing places. It is very well located in the heart of Amsterdam. I definitely recommend Pilar's place for those who wants to have a great time in Amsterdam! I would like to say thanks a lot to Pilar and I can't wait to come back soon!
2581825;29782824;2015-04-12;30243138;David;"I loved staying in Pilar's apartment!  She is a great host, and her apartment is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood.  It is very easy and quick to get into the city center, and there are nice restaurants and markets within walking distance.
Pilar was there when I checked in and checked out to make sure I had everything I needed.  Definitely consider this apartment for your next visit to Amsterdam!"
2581825;124135814;2017-01-01;90226913;Daniela;"Pilar is a very nice person and a great host. We had a very good time in her appartment. 
The appartment is very clean and had everything we needed. We stayed over sylvester so it was very good that it was not directly in the city but still it was very quick to reach. We would definitly recommend the appartment to others."
7018988;108497693;2016-10-16;98944126;Patricius;Sehr gastfreundlich und nett, hat alles mögliche getan um einen angenehmen kurzen Aufenthalt zu bieten. Falls wir nochmal nach Amsterdam  fahren, dann gerne dort wieder.
7018988;113509813;2016-11-13;97578203;Ankeet;"Accommodation provided not as per the photographs. Not a safe location, saw a car break-in.
Living room, bedroom and bathroom all were dirty with dust and cigarette ash. Microwave & gas stove were black and not cleaned. Shower & basin counter were dirty. You can have hotel stay with breakfast option at much better price. Paid 130/night for 3 people."
2503491;12080321;2014-04-22;13652759;Johanna;Jorn´s apartment was a pleasant experience. Like mentioned on the advertisement it´s clean, light and cosy. The bed is upstairs in a darker place so it´s perfect for sleeping. The apartment situates in a good and peaceful neighborhood and takes about 20 minutes by bike and/or by tram to the Central Station. Jorn was a very nice host and had time and patience to explain everything when we arrived. He was also available on the phone if a guest would have needed his help. The stairs to the apartment (3rd floor) are quite narrow and steep.
2503491;21505121;2014-10-19;160414;Lynda;"Jorn is a very perfect host. He is easily reachable and very helpful.
His flat is clean, bright and well situated.
I warmly recommend his place!"
2503491;69506083;2016-04-11;58552658;Cristina;The apartament is very spacious, clean and cute. We relly like it and we felt very comfortable. Jorn is a exceptional host, he gave us all the instructions to move around the city. If I had to say something negative is that the shower water can't be regulated well, and it pull hot and cold water at the same time. But everything else was perfect. We could repeat without hesitation. Thanks Jorn!!
2503491;74689646;2016-05-16;23043795;Pamela;"The Appartment was exactly as described and shown on the pictures.
Jorn's cleaning lady let us in and showed us around. So perfect organisation and very nice appartment!"
2503491;113557887;2016-11-13;32360523;Meryem;Pretty, warm and functional appartment, it's actually better than the pictures. Jorn is the ideal host, very welcoming, nice and helpful, he made us feel at home right away. This appartment really added to the beauty of our trip. I highly recommend it.
14414831;109849850;2016-10-23;48568894;Marsha;"Sisi is the most wonderful host. She is kind and welcoming, and went above and beyond to make us feel at home. Three of us stayed in her apartment located in the De Pijp neighborhood of Amsterdam. Her home was beautiful, clean, and all set up for us upon arrival. She left us some sweet welcome treats, as well as a very extensive lists and information of all the things you need to know about the area - emergency numbers, restaurants, tram lines, things to see, etc. De Pijp is slightly south of the center of Amsterdam - it's about a 30 minute walk, 15-20 minute tram ride, or a 10 minute uber ride. Her apartment is close walking distance to many shops, stores, and a large open market called Cuyp Market. It's the largest market in Amsterdam and it's open daily from..definitely worth checking out! 

I would highly recommend this apartment to anyway looking to stay in Amsterdam, it is a very nice place for a very great price. Thank you Sisi for making this trip so wonderful!"
14414831;124542797;2017-01-02;102119067;Maya;"A lovely apartment, best equipment!
We had a very good Time at Sisi's house"
6455099;109366798;2016-10-21;9423368;Thomas;"We had a wondefull stay at Roseannes houseboat. Lovely bright and spacious interieur. We used the bikes a lot - only 20 minutes to the centre. The cat was a wonderful host, whom our children loved to play with. 

When we arrived the refrigerator were full with juice, eggs etc., and on the kitchen table there was lots of quality chocolate and a map, where Rosanna had marked many good places to visit.
We can only recommend it to everyone looking for a stay with a personal touch outside the crowded center!"
10404760;61959505;2016-02-09;31588082;Sammy;This was my second time in Amsterdam, and by far a much better stay than the first time around. Such a convenient and cozy place to stay. Can't say anything less about my experience. Bart's place was very well kept. I was happy to hear that I broke the ice on being the first to stay there haha. Great stay!
10404760;65436718;2016-03-13;8220548;Brian;Lovely people who were so kind - even when I locked myself out of the place. Quick response to all questions. Great location and clean place. Hope to be back soon!
10404760;102767087;2016-09-19;6763840;Rebecca;A fantastic bright apartment with loads of space for a couple. Large kitchen facilities, lounge area and the bed was very comfortable! Checkin was easy and Paula's communication was excellent.

673672;5182424;2013-06-17;4917262;Jessica;Siet's houseboat is great! She is nicely situated close to the center, but away from tourists. She gave us suggestions about where to go to eat and see the sights. The beer garden at the end of her street had good food and atmosphere.
673672;8466140;2013-11-01;9182625;Ursula;Wonderful host, perfect location and a beautiful unique place to stay. The boat is located close to central station in easy walking distance to all the points of interest. Very nice to be able to cook breakfast and have the option of a home cooked meal by Siet. I have already shared Siets information with a lot of colleagues and friends a ad I will return!
673672;10837436;2014-03-10;11195250;Marcus;My 3 ladies and me, we had a very relaxed & comfortable stay in ADAM, it was a wonderful way to explore the city. The sweet little houseboat is an amazing & cosy place to stay if you want to come down a bit from your daily routine. The B'n'B is located just 2 tram stations from the main station & from the central of ADAM. Siet is very cool & polite person & she spared no effort to provide us a pleasant stay. Thanxx to Siet (and Bubi the cat!!!) for the dutch eggs and the wonderful familiar feeling during our stay. WE definitely will come back !  Cheerz, Marcus
673672;11728744;2014-04-13;11487106;Wiebs;We had a really nice stay with Siet on 'Tante Piet' ! Siet was a lovely host and helped us to get sorted in Amsterdam. Such a wonderful experience for my first time with airbnb :)
673672;12447288;2014-05-02;7177436;Christian;"Everything was really uncomplicated with Siet. We booked the room just two days before. The location of the boat is awesome. 10 minutes walk to the city center, during the day and in the evening a quiet place to stay. For our next time in Amsterdam we'll coming back to her nice house boat. 
The small room has a huge bed, an own sink and toilette...everything you need. Shower is in the front of the boat. Lovely kitchen and living room!
See you next time."
673672;72012977;2016-04-30;9427982;(EMAIL HIDDEN);"We had the most lovely stay on Sietske's house boat. She was very generous and helpful and made our trip far better than if we had stayed in a hotel as she gave us good insider tips. We arrived on Kings day and Sietske advised us what to do and where to go, which made the event all the more enjoyable.
The boat is even better than the photos convey and the location makes you feel less of a tourist and more of a local. It's in a funky area very convenient to Central Station and the ferries plus also easy access to the centre. The weather got quite cold during our visit but we were so warm with the fantastic log fire. We are immensely grateful to Sietske for giving us such a memorable and enjoyable stay."
673672;74799517;2016-05-16;54217427;Gilbert;"Ce séjour sur cette belle péniche a vraiment été super, c'est une expérience inoubliable. Sietske nous a très bien reçu et nous a mis tout de suite très à l'aise. Elle connaît très bien Amsterdam et a pu nous renseigner sur ce qu'il fallait voir et visiter. 
L'intérieur de la péniche correspond exactement à ce qui est inscrit sur le site. L'endroit est calme, proche de la gare, très confortable, très dépaysant. On est comme à la maison.
Il y a tout ce qu'il faut dans le frigo et elle peut même nous préparer un magnifique déjeuner. 
C'est une adresse dont il faut se souvenir. On reviendra..."
673672;99090906;2016-09-03;60607340;Danni;Sietske 是一个豪爽又开朗的人,我说想尝试一下荷兰的pancake,她立马说给我做一顿正宗的,感谢你,让我对阿姆斯特丹又添加了一个美好的回忆。除了厕所有点小,其他都很舒适,我们也没有觉得船会晃,Sietske 把船打扫得很干净,尤其厨房,他也说她是个爱美食的人,每次去旅行都会参加烹饪课。很喜欢住这种民宿,可以和当地人聊天互相交流,她还能告诉你哪些值得玩和吃,我觉得很超值,推荐!
673672;112501630;2016-11-06;11597456;Emanuel;This was my first AirBnB experience and it was great. The houseboat is very nice and it was a very welcoming and smooth experience overall. Sietske is a great host and although she lives on the boat too, you still have enough privacy. Would recommend and stay again!
4008728;44918450;2015-08-30;36605106;Sarah;"Six of my friends and myself went for a weekend trip to Amsterdam, to also celebrate my birthday. 
Lithal's apartment was beautiful. It's nicely furnished and meets all your needs. In the first floor there is a open kitchen and a big living room. In the upper floor there are three sleeping rooms with very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are also big enough to accommodate a bigger group. 
The highlight of the appartment was a beautiful roof top terrace. 

Lithal was very helpful and a great host, very friendly... ! She was taking car of the transportation from the airport to the apartment, she also gave some useful tips for restaurants and more. In advance she was even offering to rent bicycles for us. 
In total our stay in Amsterdam couldn't have been more  comfortable. Thank you, Lithal!"
4008728;57230797;2015-12-23;12659767;Gregory;We found that this was à perfect spot very close and perfectly accessible to all that we wanted to see and do. Lithal gave us wonderful recommendations for things to do and see on our stay. We also had 7 people in our group and it accommodated us all. The living room was cozy with plenty of space for us all to relax. The decor was beautiful and Lithal just had a new  fire place put in but we were à little dissappointed that none of the fire places worked.  We also found that the apartment hadnt been  cleaned  well. But over all it was à beautiful place and perfect location.

The place is super cool, very central and very cozy."
7606845;77299997;2016-05-31;53813149;Alexandra;The flat is very nice and bright and cosy and located in a very cool area . Definitely a place where you would like to live yourself:) But if you're very tall bathroom might seem a bit small:) For us wasn't a problem! Walking distance to the central area and amazing Vondelpark is minutes away. Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to meet Philippine Iambnb agency was in charge but she was very sweet and left us some ice cream and a city map :) The only thing we didn't like is that Iambnb wants everyone to check out before 11:00 am and it's was not very convenient as our flight was at 10pm. We stayed for a weekend only and after a night out in Amsterdam you wouldn't want to get up so early pack quickly tidy up and get out without having shower or breakfast ! But overall the place is superb!
1672419;8282368;2013-10-23;5886107;Ingrid;Joost's place is really comfortable. It's not that far from the city centre either. Plus the bed is really big and comfortable. I would recommend his place to anyone planning in staying in Amsterdam.

Joosts girlfriend picked us up and brought us to the apartment - nice move!
Check-in and check-out were no problem and couldn't be easier.
The apartment was comfortable and the kitchen was clean and everything worked without any problem.

In particular it was easy handling for us, also a nice stay and there were no problems for us.


Highly recommended!!!!"
1672419;129088871;2017-01-29;2493096;Maxim;Joost was very helpful, it was a pleasure to communicate with him during our trip to Amsterdam. As well as with Thierry who met us in the apartment. Check in and check out times were flexible which is very convenient. The apartment is a very good value for money, it is ascetic but comfortable and has everything you might need during your stay. The area around is lovely and calm, but have a good connection with the rest of the city. Tram station right in front of the entrance, Metro station is in about 7 min walk, Amstel river is just in 10 min walk.
4973038;32371382;2015-05-17;28671066;Gwendolyn;"Vivians place was a great experience in Amsterdam! Totally recommendable! Its a very cosy apartment in a great location within approximately 20 minutes walking distance to central Amsterdam. We were there as two couples, each of us had a very cozy bedroom with good mattresses and the shared bathroom was new and spotlessly clean.
 Vivian was a great host who made us feel very welcome and homey, she even put some beer for us in the fridge :-) Thanks to her recommendation we enjoyed a very nice evening at the foodfestival Rolling Kitchens, which we wouldn´t have found without her help for sure.  
Should we go back to Amsterdam we would love to stay at her home again.
Thank you for a very nice weekend."

It is in the larger Amsterdam center, still good enough for doing things on foot. It takes about half an hour to the centre of the city.
Place is very nice, clean and feels like recently renewed."
9245626;91918373;2016-08-07;26492910;Desiree;"We loved Jorns apartment! Very clean, light, modern, with a nice backyard garden, a very comfortable bed and lots of books and good music! Communication with Jorn was just great. Flexible Checkin/out, he did everything he could do to make it easy and comfortable for us. He even left breakfast and a bottle of red wine! The apartment is situated in a quiet neighbourhood in the west of Amsterdam, close to huge westerpark and westergasfabriek with many cafés and restaurants. 
If you like to live like a local in Amsterdam, we highly recommand to book his apparment!"
52490;14315212;2014-06-16;12660808;Sarah;The apartment is bright and clean, located in a quiet neighborhood with canal view all around. As I came on business, the place really gave me the feeling of coming home after hard day at work. Victor being a superb host is absolutely a plus!
52490;19629982;2014-09-15;16146746;Joey;Victor was a great host, he helped us with directions and showed us Dutch breakfast. The water bed was very comfortable and the canal view was great.

He has a very nice apartment and the location is wonderful - just next to a tram stop that goes to the central station. The room was clean and we had everything we needed for our stay. It was very kind of him that he allowed us to use the kitchen and we prepared dinner several times.

7382264;55621061;2015-12-03;11552483;Francoise;Flavio very helpful. Clean basic apartment,  good location as very close to transport.
7382264;57524820;2015-12-27;47162678;Dennis;Flávio is nice and his home is so convenient! We have stayed there for 2 nights and the place only take 15 mins tram to central station. Unfortunately we are unable to talk much because we have to go out! But definitely will choose to stay here again next time.
7382264;59416314;2016-01-10;51753735;Zhenyu;Flavio is a very nice host ,easy to communicte with in English.the house is very clean. near the tram station which takes 10-15mins to centraal . thanks for hosting!
7382264;59851167;2016-01-16;44006203;Pedro;"The bedroom is exactly what the picture shows. Very cosy, tidy and clean. The flat is very well located, and it's easy to go to the city centre simply by taking a tram in front of the building (it takes aprox. 20 minutes to get into the town).
To make everything better, Flávio is a super host! One of the best hosts that I've ever known in Airbnb. He is always ready to help you, friendly and do what he can to make you feel at home. I would strongly recommend you to stay here. I've already had a place to stay in my next trip to Amsterdam."
7382264;67376211;2016-03-29;29569386;Vivian;Flávio é uma pessoa atenciosa e fez de tudo para que nossa estadia fosse perfeita. O quarto e os outros cômodos são exatamente como as fotos, e tudo foi super aconchegante e limpo. Apartamento é muito perto da estação de tram, facilitando o deslocamento para o centro da cidade. Adorei e com certeza quando voltar pra Amsterdã ficarei na casa dele

The room is comfortable and the department is located in a nice area, only 15 mins from the central station."
7382264;76237493;2016-05-25;45782297;Larissa;Flávio was an excellent host! Very nice room, shared a bathroom with Flávio but everything was clean and perfect and there was no real inconvenience. Awesome neighborhood far away from tourists!
7382264;78056994;2016-06-05;37568073;Joao Filipe;Flavio was the best host we could have asked for. The house was always impecable, very clean and tidy and Flávio really made us feel at home. The house is very well located,just a few steps from the tram and bus stops. We would definitely stay at Flavio's house again the next time we visit Amsterdam.
7382264;96262489;2016-08-22;50338695;Ruiyi;It is a very good place for living,and Flavio is a nice person,strongly recommended!
7382264;110116210;2016-10-24;32406469;John & Emma;"Flávio was a terrific host! He picked us up from the airport for a small fare and was very helpful with anything that we needed. Room was comfy for the weekend (true to pictures).  Only a  15 minute tram ride to central station running every 5 minutes. 
Highly recommend Flávio's to anyone visiting Amsterdam.
Thank you Flávio, Wahoo!"

4859337;26179871;2015-02-06;19450228;Isma;Yves ha sido un amfitrion fantástico. Nos vino a buscar a la estación de tram y nos guió hasta su casa. Nos enseñó el barrio y nos explicó el funcionamiento y las normas de su apartamento. La casa estaba muy limpia y ordenada. Fué una estancia muy comoda y tranquila para disfrutar de esta magnifica ciudad. Os recomiendo que contacteis con él sin ninguna duda.
4859337;108381962;2016-10-16;74617050;Manuel;Good place to stay for a trip to Amsterdam! Yves was very kind and helpful with figuring out parking situation etc. I'd absolutely recommend this place if you want to stay in a quiet place but which is still relatively close to the city Centre.

The location is ideal, an incredibly short bike ride away from everything that anyone could want to see. The apartment itself was gorgeous, well furnished, light and there was even a nice balcony to sit on for evening drinks.

I heartly recommend this apartment and thank very much to Eefje.

Sweet and quite area with supermarket and coffee near by.
The host was really nice and answered any questions we had, and left us with some great recommendations! 
Highly recommended!"
1585086;53817149;2015-11-13;45385675;Joachim;"Hallo Eefje,
Schon bei unserer Ankunft fühlten wir uns gleich wohl. Es war wirklich toll bei dir, die Wohnung war sehr schön, ruhig und ein idealer Ausgangspunkt um die Stadt und die Museen kennen zu lernen. Besonders genial waren auch die beiden Fahrräder, mit denen wir jeden Tag unterwegs waren. Vielen Dank für den guten Tipp mit dem supergünstigen P&R-Parkhaus und den leckeren Willkommensgruß! 
Viele liebe Grüße aus Deutschland

634170;4575600;2013-05-13;3788958;Marinus;Carolina's office apartment is a perfect crashpad for an enjoyable stay in Amsterdam. It is spacious, well equipped and well located (right in front of the Westerpark/Westergasfabriek cultural venue). Tram & bus are around the corner for an easy access to the city centre. In addition, Carolina is a very welcoming host and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. The fridge was fully furnished for breakfast and snacks, and she also handed us a great selection of maps and tips for our ballads in the city. All in all, a highly recommended place. Thanks, Carolina!
634170;4713665;2013-05-21;6148242;Sabrina;"We (4 friends) had a wonderful long weekend in Amsterdam. Carolina is a wonderful host--super friendly and helpful with everything we needed (full fridge, city maps, etc.). The apartment is really good located and it was very lovely and quiet. Good price/performance ratio.
We would definitely recommend it."
634170;11555249;2014-04-07;13228219;Sofia;"We just came back from an awesome weekend in Amsterdam! We were a group of girls who went for a reunion and a nice catch up in Amsterdam. 

Carolina is such a nice person and such a great host!
Very helpful from the first moment, gave us a lot of information, we felt we could trust her and it was our first time with Airbnb.

The apartment is modern, clean and nice! She had bought so many things for us, the fridge was full of things more than enough for our breakfast.
We feel very comfortable with each other so it didn't feel uncomfortable to stay all together. There are not separate rooms as the top floor where there is another double bed is open from one side and you can see downstairs. We liked this a lot though as it was what we wanted! Depends on people's preference.

The area is quiet and is 2min walk to the westerpark with lots of cafes and a nice market on the first Sunday of the month. In one of those cafes i had the best coffee in these 2 days and we had a few. We walked to the Jordaan area, which is beautiful and very close to the apartment. There is a bus stop honestly 1min from the apartment which takes you in around 10min to the Centraal station. Of course you can easily walk within 30min as it's a straight line.

Overall our stay was great and we had an amazing time.
I would like to come back and explore the city more.
Thanks Carolina and we wish you all the best!
Sofia and the rest! :-)"
634170;12278878;2014-04-28;12733825;Olga;"It was a great pleasure to be Carolina's guests! She provided us all that we needed and even more (including orange clothes for the King's Day :)  The apartment is comfortable and cozy so we felt like at home. Also it is situated in very nice place: quiet, ""green"" and easy to get to all sights.
We wish Carolina all very very best!"
634170;12742229;2014-05-10;12268332;Elaine;We really enjoyed our stay at Westerpark Sanctuary. The neighbourhood was lovely. Westerpark was across from the building complex, less than a 5 minute walk, and is a beautiful respite from the city. The apartment is very big, much larger than we expected, with plenty of room for 3 of us. Everything we could have possibly needed was available. The tram stops right near the apartment, and Central Station is about a 20-30 minute walk (public transport is also available). Carolina stocked the fridge and cupboards with odds and ends for us so we wouldn't have to go out and purchase food right when we arrived. She was very helpful with information about the city, and even brought us fresh tulips. Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better apartment or hostess. Thanks Carolina for a wonderful stay in Amsterdam! I would highly recommend this place!

Каролина - очень гостеприимная и отзывчивая женщина. Апартаменты удобные и в очень хорошем состоянии. Мы были компанией 4 друзей на выходных - и нам очень понравилось. Также Каролина заботится о своих гостях и предоставляет перед поездкой всю необходимую и полезную информацию. Всем рекомендую!

Carolina is a very hospitable and kind hearted woman. The apartments are comfortable and are in a very good condition. We (a group of 4 friends) stayed here for a weekend and loved it very much. Carolina really cares about her guests and provides all the necessary and useful information before and during your stay. I definitely recommend Carolina and her apartments to everyone!"
634170;15455581;2014-07-09;16156198;Dee;Westerpark Sanctuary was my first airbnb experience and it was great. Carolina provided very helpful, detailed directions to the apartment, which was clean and comfortable. She made us feel at ease. We appreciated the food items to get us started for breakfast. The location was excellent and a quiet respite at the end of the day. We were able to walk most of the time around the city and only used the bus once. Carolina was also helpful in helping us obtain rental bikes from a shop right in the complex which we used to go out of town. The nearby restaurant in the nearby building is a wonderful place to go.
634170;25131501;2015-01-07;23426067;Henning;"Wir wurden sehr, sehr herzlich von Carolina empfangen. Für das erste Frühstück war der Kühlschrank von ihr reich bestückt worden. Schon vor unserem Aufenthalt versorgte uns Carolina per Mail mit wertvollen, umfangreichen Informationen zur Anreise und auch Sehenswürdigkeiten und Restauranttips. Sie sorgte unter anderem sogar für eine Tischreservierung mit Geburtstagsüberraschung zum Dessert...
Carolina ist eine perfekte, sehr herzliche Gastgeberin, die ausser perfekt Deutsch übrigens noch sechs weitere Fremdsprachen spricht.  Das Appartement, vor allem die Küche ist komplett ausgestattet, uns fehlte überhaupt nichts. Die untere, grosszügige  Wohnebene mit Essbereich und Sitzecke hat eine sehr hohe Aufenthaltsqualität. Die offene Schlafgalerie ist gemütlich, mit offenem Dachgebälk. Die Wohnung ist sehr ruhig gelegen, nachts ist es in dem Wohnhof am Wasserturm sehr ruhig. Eine Bus- und eine Strassenbahnhaltestelle mit guter Anbindung an den Centraal-Bahnhof befinden sich jeweils eine Gehminute entfernt. 
Der Westerpark mit zahlreichen Eventlocations und Restaurant ist in fünf Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen. Wir möchten Carolinas Appartement absolut empfehlen und freuen uns auf das nächste Mal bei ihr."
634170;33361271;2015-05-27;6745054;Gisele;I don't even know if I have enough words to describe how incredible Carolina was to us. Our arrival was very late and yet she was there all happy to receive us. The apartment is amazing, everything very clean, charming, and cozy. I felt home there. The bed was so comfortable that it felt like I was on a 5 star hotel. Carolina is very thoughtful and the apartment is ready to attend all your needs. The location is great, close to bus stops, tram, restaurants, park, supermarket and Carolina has a list of important locations ready for you. I'm not only recommend her place, I will most likely stay there again when I return to Amsterdam.
634170;35217905;2015-06-16;31881044;Keith;We stayed with Carolina for 3 days and she made our experience an unforgettable time. It is located in a nice quiet part of town with the tram very close to get into the city.  The Cafe amsterdam near the bnb has very good bitterballen. The place was very clean and she even provided some beer, cheese, fruit and bread! I would stay with Carolina again if I return to Amsterdam.
634170;75910276;2016-05-23;19277053;Andrea;*Baby friendly!!* Carolina was very easy to communicate with.  She met us at the bus stop and walked us to our apartment.  We were traveling with our 1 year old baby, and Carolina was very accommodating for her.  She provided baby gates for the stairs, baby tub, high chair and roll away bed, even some fun toys.  She was incredibly warm, welcoming and gave a very informative brief on the transportation systems, surrounding shops/grocery stores and things to do.  She had maps, take away food menus, and pamphlets available.  The kitchen had everything you could need and the apartment was beautiful and quiet.  Great spot for transportation too, the Bus 21 and Tram 10 stop steps away.  We loved it and will definitely be back!
634170;87951580;2016-07-22;62802404;Elaine;Carolina is an excellent host, she did a wonderful job in welcoming us.  She arranged to have the basics there for us on arrival: milk, bread, eggs, even cookies for the kids!!  She took us through how everything worked in the apartment which was very helpful in settling in.  The location is ideal, really easy to get to the city centre by tram & bus (both just around the corner from the apartment).  The Westerpark area is perfect for relaxing in one of the many restaurants and bars.  It's a really family friendly area, we even had a picnic in the park on two evenings which was great fun.
634170;139979446;2017-03-27;30335701;Oliver;Great host. Great apartment. Great stay. I would definitely recommend!
17187058;135776657;2017-03-06;66978866;Yang;Rocio and Joan are fantastic!! They have a lovely place and a really cute cat lol. The apartment is close to the tram station and in a quiet neighborhood.

Really good connection to the city center with the tram line. Llona has been a really kind host, she has given us some good tips to were to go clubbing."
579851;111806235;2016-11-01;9763556;Orlane;"Simplement extraordinaire!!
Bateau magnifique, l'accueil de Sonja était des plus convivial et la situation parfait. Proche du centre à vélo mais suffisamment en retrait pour être au calme.
Merci Sonja pour avoir rendu notre séjour à Amsterdam inoubliable."
579851;120977357;2016-12-12;82899757;Danielle;The pictures and description don't actually do this fantastic house boat justice. It is beautiful and was an absolute pleasure to stay in. Sonja was really helpful on arrival but left us to it once we were settled in.  There were plenty of amenities and Sonja had put some very personal touches in place such as fresh bread, sparkling wine and milk available for us. We are very grateful for her hospitality.
579851;126373273;2017-01-11;50048483;Marcus;The Tasmania was hands down one of the most beautiful and unique places we stayed at on our recent trip to Europe. It is located near a bunch of good restaurants and bars and the space was very nice and comfortable. Sonja and her husband really made us feel at home. Would highly recommend.
579851;128014453;2017-01-22;34245341;Margaux;Séjour fantastique sur la péniche de Sonja! La chambre est parfaitement équipée, Sonja est une hôte très attentive qui donne beaucoup de conseils de restaurants/bars. Les vélos qu'elle nous prête sont parfaits pour découvrir Amsterdam et rester dans l'ambiance de cette magnifique ville! Un grand merci!
579851;135233229;2017-03-04;5330282;Andreas;One word: AWESOME!
579851;137396081;2017-03-15;17706923;Bruno;The experience was even better than what was described online. My parents absolutely loved staying in the boat and felt really comfortable and close to the city.
15560850;115830763;2016-11-27;24973434;Rachel;We had a wonderful experience at Christina apartment. Cristina was very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. She even go out of her way to help me while I was sick during my vacation in Amsterdam, which I greatly appreciated her for that. The apartment is beyond wonderful, it's very clean, chic and home warming feeling. It has everything you need at home. I almost wish that is home. We arrived earlier than the time we can check in. Cristina allows us to drop off our luggages earlier, so we don't need to drag our luggages around before the check in time. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and we would love to stay with Cristina again when we visit Amsterdam next time!
15082885;123619861;2016-12-30;86016735;Vanda;The boat is big, not too far from the center, the heating works well, but for the price the place is very dirty!! The fridge was mouldy, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, dirty bathrobe, dirty moquette in the bedroom. No words for the outside, it's sad to see such a nice boat not taken care of the right way. Also the money spent is too much!!!! Very disappointed
8087636;47574913;2015-09-20;38926473;Lauren;Joris and Danielle were excellent hosts during our stay. They made us feel very welcome and were very helpful. The apartment is beautiful and modern in a great location. Thank you for making our stay so wonderful!
8087636;50876449;2015-10-15;1638377;Angela;Oh, my! What a gorgeous room and lovely hosts!  Truly, all is tended to with care.  They even shared chocolate, offered to cook breakfast before my way-too-early departure, sat down with me to review the city offerings and best directions... Mine was a quick over-night stay given a mere 12 hours between flights - even so, I found myself easily walking to some well known spots, and very much enjoyed everything around.  Noted is that a couple blocks away is Urban Cocoa!  I slept here the best that I had during my prior 9 days traveling.  The two little pups in the household are well behaved and sweet.  The space is clean, and I could just gush on forever about how wonderful this stay was...!
8087636;63938096;2016-02-28;312537;Mary;Joris and Daniella were lovely hosts - warm and welcoming. The room is as shown in photos, private with very comfortable bed. The location is central enough, just outside nine streets, with easy access by bus from Schiphol. The stairs up to 3rd floor are typical Dutch narrow, not for anyone with mobility issues. I was made to feel very at home, including the friendliest welcome by the dogs. Thanks for the hot toddy, and good company.
8087636;73124181;2016-05-07;4483476;Bram;Danielle was a nice host, with a tasteful smoothie as breakfast on our first morning. Great neigboorhood, so we didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment :)
8087636;80263550;2016-06-17;19743647;Braden;Joris was great. So accommodating. He waited up for me late the first night because of a delayed flight. He got me settled and gave me all the information I needed. The location is awesome. I highly recommend. Thanks Joris.
8087636;93441187;2016-08-12;5128708;Sophie;Thanks Joris and his girlfriend for such a nice stay! It was rather short, but still it was very lovely. The room is beautiful and dogs are amazing of course :)
876543;11721121;2014-04-13;3998620;Marc;Ce fut une très mauvaise expérience. L'appartement était sale : mégot de cigarette, poils de chien, poussière, murs sales. Bruyant : pas d'isolation, musique des voisins tard dans la nuit, voisin qui vient frapper la nuit, coups de marteau. Mal équipé, pas de lit mais des matelas par terre, pas de table, pas de chaises. Nauséabond, du vieux saucisson dans le frigo, la poubelle pas vidée. Insalubre, le plafond tombe en morceau. A ne pas faire, surtout avec des enfants. On se demande à quoi servent les 50€ pour le nettoyage.
876543;12332995;2014-04-29;4112753;Will;Filine's place across the water from Amsterdam Station is a superb apartment, built inside an old industrial unit, the accommodation feels quite unique to other places I have stayed. Many people live in the block and you get the sense of community whilst, there is a lovely park nearby and you are only being a ferry ride from the city hub.
876543;15764775;2014-07-15;14302856;Yasmine;"L' hôtesse est une personne très sympathique et disponible.

876543;20997058;2014-10-09;20799586;Mario;"Monolocale ampissimo e ben arredato, con tutti i comfort che ti aspetti dagli abitanti di una capitale come Amsterdam. Distante dal centro dalla città ma comunque ben collegato grazie ai battelli disponibili h24. Quartiere molto tranquillo e con tutti i servizi di prima e seconda necessità. 
Filine è una persona squisita, cordiale e molto comprensiva. Difficilmente si trovano padroni di casa di questo tipo, quasi unica! 
Un commento a parte lo meritano le due poltrone presenti nell'appartamento (una in foto)...sono una delle cose che mi mancano di più di quella fantastica settimana di vacanza.

A studio very spacious and well furnished, with all the comforts you would expect from Amsterdam's inhabitant. Quite far from the city center but well linked with the three ferry boats available h24. Very quiet neighborhood with all first and second necessity facilities. 
Filine is a very nice and friendly perso. It's hard to find host like her, she's almost unique! A note for the two chairs in the apartment (see picture)...I miss them too much!"

876543;46284912;2015-09-09;19236420;Adam;"Had a wonderful stay at Filine's apartment! Filine really made us feel at home and made us feel completely relaxed in the apartment. It was a good location near a number of ferries, especially if you have bikes to get around. 

Right from the start Filine was a lot of fun and really got the trip off to a great start.

The apartment was comfortable and had everything you need for a short stay. Very interesting and unique building making for a very cool apartment. 

All in all we had a great time and Filine was an excellent host. Would love to go back in the future and us the apartment again!"
876543;48713614;2015-09-28;40454760;T;It was a nice stay for up to 6 people. It was a little bit out of town but it is only a 15min footwalk to the ferry to the central Station which is free. All in all a very nice stay. We will come back

876543;60400583;2016-01-23;52289213;Ellie;We have  just had a wonderful stay at Filine's apartment in Amsterdam this week. It was spacious - open plan with two floors. The room upstairs was perfect for a group of friends on holiday together, with our beds in a row and a big televion. The mini kitchen was very useful, two fridges so lots of space - and kindly Filine left us some food and milk. No oven, but we made do! Careful of the smoke alarm above the toaster!! Just an easy 5-10 min walk to closest bus stop and a two stop bus to the centre (2.90euros each way)! Would definitely stay again, thank you Filine!!!

14046777;92650769;2016-08-09;2967175;Mihalis;We had a great stay at Shane's cozy flat. It is a bit away from all the action but still close enough in a quiet residential area. Shane is a good communicator and made us feel relaxed from the initial contact to the end.

5501544;43363903;2015-08-19;33591310;Adi;Our experience at Regine's house was impecable. We're a family of four (parents & 2 girls) and loved the house for its whitness and largness, its innumerable carefully selected and beautiful details and artworks, its bright and warm atmosphere. This is a house to feel at home, not a mere crashpad. All necessary appliances were also at hand. The kitchen was beautiful and well equipped, great to cook our meals at. The neighborhood quiet and beautiful,  with shops, restaurants, supermarkets, tram, what have you nearby. Regine welcomed us personally and was available and attentive all through the week we stayed. There's really nothing bad we can say.  The dutch stairs? We grew accustomed quickly and actually began to appreciate them in the end. Warmly recommended.

Das Haus ist sehr hell und sauber, liegt in einer schönen ruhigen Gegend von Amsterdam, die trotzdem nur ca 15 min mit dem Fahrrad vom Zentrum entfernt ist. Unsere Gastgeberin hat sich, trotzdem sie an diesem Wochende nicht in Amsterdam war um alles bestens gekümmert und uns tolle Tipps  gegeben ( sehr gutes Restaurant in der Nähe, Fahrradverleih). Die Unterkunft ist absolut empfehlenswert und ich würde jederzeit wieder hinfahren.

6162356;116160033;2016-11-28;5031586;Anne;We had a great stay at Bob's apartment. We did not meet him but he was very available and easy to communicate with, and sent a very useful guide to the apartment and the city before we arrived. The apartment itself is very spacious and has a lovely terrace where we had coffee each morning (even if the November temperatures meant we didn't stay out for there for long!). There is a tram stop right outside, but we preferred to explore Amsterdam by foot. The location is about a 20-30 minute walk to the inner ring area of the city, but there were plenty of nice bars and restaurants within a five minute walk for when we didn't feel like heading back into the city centre in the evening. Overall a great place to stay and feel like a local. Thanks Bob!
6323385;47081327;2015-09-15;3955425;Meredith;Caroline and Jelle were great hosts! They were super responsive and and sent me a great email ahead of time with anything I would need to know about the apartment and a great recommendations for what to do in the area. The location was great, right near Vondelpark. I would stay there again!
425575;2680317;2012-10-22;3349195;Pavel;Very nice spacy apps by Maud Clijsen with astonishing view of Canal definitely good for nice comfort evenings with a bottle of good wine observing the view through the large windows!!!
425575;12412286;2014-05-01;14401734;Alexandra;Magnificent is the word to describe this apartment spacious beautiful great location, everything you can need or wish is already inside. Moreover Maud is a great host nice warm smart and helpful. Highly recommended!
425575;40900978;2015-08-03;283726;Marc & Tina;Lovely flat in a great location. Hosts were helpful and accommodating, pretty much everything you could want in Amsterdam is  a half hour walk away.
425575;53505046;2015-11-09;8593114;Sandra;Maud made us feel very welcome. She was there if we had any questions. The flat was wonderful, great size and overlooking the canals and  the neighborhood is great.
425575;65703264;2016-03-16;59909141;Samantha;The host met us at the air bnb and was very accommodating and sweet. The apartment itself was perfect for four and very clean and neat. We had all the linens we needed, the bed was super comfortable and so was the extra bed and the pull out. Also great location.
425575;67410494;2016-03-29;27744845;Francesc;"Magnific pis al centre d'Amsterdam! Molt acollidor, preciòs i molt ben amoblat. La millor forma de veure la ciutat. Vam anar amb nens i ha estat com si hi visquessim. El tracte familiar, discret i molt receptiu. repetirem segur.

Stunning apartment in the right center of Amsterdam. Walking distances everywhere. Excelent flat! Excelent acomodation with children. Very cozy and very well treated. 100 /100 recomended. We will come back for sure. It was like being home."
425575;71095171;2016-04-23;6590729;Joanie;We had a very good experience staying in Maud's house.  The beautiful Windows and canal views were peaceful after busy days.  The kitchen is fully stocked and the bed and bedding were very comfortable.  We had an early arrival and used Melody taxi as recommended for 30E.  We were able to drop off bags and check in slightly early.  We loved the nespresso machine.  The location is excellent!  Thank you for ordering sunshine Maud!
425575;110253142;2016-10-25;49280431;Merethe;Maud's apartment was excellent in every way - clean, well-equipped, superb location, comfortable beds. Very nice and accomodating host. I highly recommend staying here, and I would love to come back some day!
3153836;18484196;2014-08-27;18326605;Jane;"The apartment was just as described.  It was clean, tidy, and very bright, with lots of windows, and quite spacious for two people; the neighborhood was quiet, and very safe, and two blocks from Museumplein.  About two blocks in a different direction was the fabulous Vondelpark!  Although we were committed to walking all over the city, on one occasion in the rain we took advantage of the #2 tram, which stopped practically in front of the flat to deliver us home to dine ""in"" for the evening.  Our host (Hedwig) was very kind, and accommodated us when we changed our dates by a day for a better arrival time for the international flight.  She welcomed us with juice and coffee and pastry, and was always available to us to answer any questions.  I appreciated very much that she was flexible about our arrival and departure times, given our own inflexible schedule because of the flight times."
3153836;30924279;2015-04-29;27281076;Marjorie;"Doug looked up as we got off the tram and said ""she's waving to us!""  We were warmly welcomed by Jan to a comfortable flat where we immediately felt at home.   As a ""guest house"" for far flung family members, the apartment is well equipped.   We loved the access to the museums (the reason for our visit), but the neighborhood was also terrific, just enough cafes and restaurants, an organic grocery store--what more could one wish for?  The views of the busy crossing from the windows (first floor for Europeans, second for Americans) were a constant delight, but there was no traffic noise because of good window panes."
3153836;68731290;2016-04-06;8937620;Mark;The apartment was lovely as described, and the neighborhood is fabulous. There is a fine restaurant downstairs, numerous cafes and shops around the corner, and the park and museums near by.  Hedwig is a special hostess, and we are grateful to her for coming early to greet us on arrival and for helping us with our bags on departure.  The steep staircase was a challenge for two seniors who travel with too much luggage.
3153836;124565600;2017-01-02;1385019;Wayne;Everything in the flat was as promised--great location, easy access to the tram right outside the door, steps away from Vondelpark, plenty of grocery stores, shops in the area, etc. We have stayed at several great Airbnb places but this one was head and shoulders above the rest.  Can't really say enough good things about this place and the kind owners. Stay there--you won't be disappointed!
2758333;31323353;2015-05-04;15181842;Sylvie;appartement traversant très agréable, à 15 mn par bus ou tram du centre ville.
2758333;69246266;2016-04-10;60585347;Anna Maria;l'accoglieza di Jan è stata puntuale e molto cordiale.
2758333;87074791;2016-07-18;59025775;Felicitas;"I was staying with 2 girlfriends at Jan's appartment and we really enjoyed our stay! As a welcome gift, a bottle of red wine and stroopwafels, a typical dutch sweet treat was waiting for us. The appartment was very clean, cozy and very light. In the morning, the sunlight was at the side of the bedroom and in the afternoon and evening the living room was sun-drenched. It was very quiet as well which ensured us a nice sleep. The appartment is located in a friendly and quiet neighborhood and a supermarket is very nearby. 
Jan provided us fresh towels, so we did not have to bring them on our own, which was very convenient. As we were in 3, two of us were sleeping in the bed and I stayed on the sofa, which was indeed very comfortable. I am not very tall, so it was fine for me.
Jan is a very friendly, helpful and attentive host and we can highly recommend to stay at his place!"
2758333;114423083;2016-11-18;5319717;Laura;"Jan Willem was on holiday and anything related to the apartment rental and communication through airbnb was being handled by an external Amsterdam based company (called iambnb). This review therefore applies to their services. The amount we paid was comparable to a mid-level hotel in Amsterdam, so that’s what I will compare their services to. To summarize: the apartment is nice, and I was glad to able to cook. I do however think that hotel-level prices are too high when I look at what the apartment lacked (small bed, lamps not working) and what a hotel in that price range does have (daily cleaning, reception, maintenance). 
My boyfriend and I had to find a new place for a few days with very short notice, because our own apartment was temporarily uninhabitable due to water damage. It was possible to rent this apartment the same day. We were not told before we finalized the booking that we would not be communicating with Jan Willem but with iambnb. 
Things that were good:
+ The apartment is was renovated quite recently, and everything was clean. It is larger than most hotel rooms, about 70m2.
+ Fully equipped kitchen
Things that need to be improved. :
- The bed is not a standard 140 by 200 cm, but smaller. I measured it and it is 120 by 200 cm. This is a so-called 'twijfelaar', which is a size in between a one person and two person bed. Since it was too small one of us had to sleep on the couch. I recommend listing in the ad how large the bed is to prevent other people from having this experience. 
-Moreover, I inquired beforehand how large the bed was, and was told the wrong size. I would not have chosen this apartment if I had known how small the bed was. The company iambnb provided us with extra bedlinens for the couch, and we were given a discount of 60 euros as compensation.
-The lamps in living room and the toilet were not working. I called and they delivered a new bulb for the one in the living room, the one in the toilet was not fixed. I think we would have been better off in a hotel in this instance, since they could have sent someone from maintenance.
-Check-out time is 11 o’clock in the morning. For most hotels I´ve stayed in it is 12, so it is rather early.  Additionally, for me the main advantage of Airbnb over a hotel are the flexible check in/out times."
2758333;124144188;2017-01-01;105666545;Rafed Khalil;"Very nice appartment and close to public trasportations.
Not far from city center.

6912095;66942500;2016-03-25;20852807;H.-Alfred;Wer eine schöne Unterkunft etwas außerhalb der City von Amsterdam (südlich) möchte,  der ist hier genau richtig. Die Wohnung ist durch die fußläufige Nähe der Metro sowie der  Haltestellen derTram-Linien 12 und 4 sehr gut an die Innenstadt angebunden, Cafes und Geschäfte sind in der Nähe. Wir haben einige Male zwischen verschiedenen Aktionen eine Mittagspause dort eingelegt, das fanden wir sehr praktisch. Die Wohnumgebung ist ruhig, die Nachbarn freundlich, das Haus hat drei Wohnetagen.. Die Wohnung (in der ersten Etage) ist für zwei Leute großzügig, die Küche auch für kleinen Mahlzeiten mit allen Geräten gut bestückt, das Schlafzimmer liegt zum Garten hin (also leise), es gibt ein Wohnzimmer(großer Fernseher) mit einer Essecke, ein Badezimmer mit Dusche und WC. Tim ist ein sehr freundlicher Gastgeber, der bei der Schlüsselübergabe alles erklärt hat und auch sonst jederzeit telefonisch erreichbar ist.  Wir können diese Unterkunft nur empfehlen.
6912095;67563412;2016-03-30;22185377;Halim;"Notre séjour dans l'appartement de Tim s'est très bien passé. L'endroit est fonctionnel et bien entretenu; Tim quant à lui à su rester disponible pendant notre séjour pour nous aiguiller à la moindre interrogation. 
Je recommande !"
4939811;87025371;2016-07-18;2067555;Camille;"Patrick and Charlotte's place was great! It is exactly as described. We brought our 15 month old and it was perfect. We didn't get to meet but had a straightforward key pick-up and were provided with all the information we needed.
Neighborhood is fantastic with loads of restaurants and nice walk into city centre. Would love to stay again!"
9891417;64065205;2016-02-29;54324851;Georgina;We have really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is beautiful. It is clean and modern. The location could not get better. The apartment is on the 4th floor so you are high enough not to be disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the red light district. Maud and cendy are ever so helpful and really make you feel welcome. They were very accommodating with our requests. I would stay here every time I visit Amsterdam and highly recommended it to family and friends.
9891417;71289111;2016-04-24;43991516;Gisle;"Great place to stay!
Very centrally situated and the flat has a perfect layout for a group of people. The host was very friendly and everything was set up perfectly. Couldn't have asked for a better service! Thank you:)"
9891417;114704691;2016-11-20;34726239;Vitaliy;"Very clean and everything is brand new. I was a bit concerned about noice at night and staying with children in the Red Light district. However, because the flat was on 4th floor, it was really quiet sleep, two bedrooms face a backside with fantastic view on cathedral and it is really safe. In short, it is a perfect location to stay Amsterdam and great accommodation for a family or group. Nothing to say ""however"", just excellent!"
9891417;126593192;2017-01-13;40157456;Jeffrey;A wonderful spacious place for adults, the location is in the middle of the dam district, with plenty of evening entertainment. My friends and I found it easy to walk to and from central train station, multiple Tram stops , dam square,  hundreds of restaurants and shopping areas,  museums and the Anne Frank House.  My only recommendation to future guests would be to pack light as there is a washer and dryer in this upper flat  apartment. I would give this location with it's spacious and clean living area including it's amenities and over-all communications with the host  a 5 out of 5 stars experience!
9891417;135936369;2017-03-07;56673814;Robert;"I wish I could come up with something original to say about this charming place,  but the previous reviews already said everything I want to say!
Yes,  the beds are sooo comfortable.  I slept like a baby.  We all did.
Yes, there are plenty of stairs to get to the apartment...70 to be exact...but I just figured it helped work off all of the calories from the cheese and beer I consumed!
Yes, it's technically in the Red Light District.  However, if you're hesitating on booking this place because of its ""Red Light"" district location,  fear not.  I was concerned as well.  But it's on the very edge of the neighborhood.  I saw nothing offensive.  Another bonus was being able to walk from the train station in a few minutes.  Great location in my opinion.
Loved the church bells.  Right next door too the oldest church in the city.  I appreciated the 8am wake up call from the church!
Oh,  and the washing machine/dryer, dish washer, full sized refrigerator, microwave oven/oven, full shower plus bath tub, blow dryer, ironing board and iron are all very much appreciated by these Americans!
I hope to be back.
Thank you Maud and Cendy for a seamless experience.
Best,
Robert"

7638175;76810437;2016-05-29;13882499;Matt & Marta;Although we haven't met Femke, we had a very pleasant stay. Her apartment is stylish and clean. It's conveniently located on the first floor so you get the privacy without having to climb lots of narrow stairs. The location of the apartment itself cannot be faulted. Located in the heart of jordaan its close to all tourist attractions without the hustle and bustle of the centre. The only negative - the bedroom is extremely bright and the curtains there are not thick enough to keep the room dark. So if you like to sleep in be prepared to be woken by the sun in the morning. Apart from that, really great apartment.
5856501;29243196;2015-04-05;30401762;Alexandra;"Very pleasant weekend at Rik's place ! 
We were free to do whatever we wanted but still he was there to guide and suggest restaurants or other things.

The location is ideal, the flat clean and luminous.
I recommend :)"
5856501;32631504;2015-05-19;14440921;John;Risk and Nanet were warm and gracious hosts. When we arrived they had travel guides and sightseeing ideas waiting for us. They were a big highlight in our trip to Amsterdam. Stay with them if you can!
5856501;78146071;2016-06-05;75049902;Mylene;Everything was perfect: the flat, the roof top, the situation, and the hosts! Rick and Nanet are lovely people. They are very welcoming. They took time to share their good plans to visit Amsterdam and enjoy the city and are very flexible on the hours. They also are very interesting people to discuss with. We definitely recommend them!
5856501;95081252;2016-08-18;47600175;Greg;"The apartment exceeded our expectations. It is in a good neighbourhood (2 metro stations to the inner city), the view is fantastic and the interiour design better than on the pictures. Rik made us feel welcome and made sure we were having a good time. He also provided us with a card to get free bikes at any train station.

Overall a fantastic experience"
2180729;52265616;2015-10-27;10855496;Florian;"Bas' flat is very nicely set up, with one bedroom located in a lovely duplex above the flat. It is furnished with taste. Overall it's a rather old and slightly run-down flat, however the way it is has been fitted out and designed by Bas makes up for it. Overall a nice appartment in a non-touristy area, so perfect if you want to experience ""real"" amsterdammer life without being too far from the city centre. 
Make sure you have Bas or the person welcoming you (for us it was Stefanie) explain you how the heating works. 
Stairs are very steep, beware."

3358926;14934629;2014-06-29;13514449;Max;Good location, green area, calm, relaxing place in only 15 minutes to centre by bike. Big old garden, birds and frogs concerts, sailing boats on the river. Very cozy appartment decor. All as memories of some ideal childhood. Marrigje and her family are very friendly, told a lot of interesting about Amsterdam and surroundings. Thanks again Marrigje, we spent unforgettable week at your boat.
3358926;20430646;2014-09-29;19937077;Eric;"We stayed a weekend at Marrigje's wonderful place! Her boat is somewhat hidden in a beautiful garden on the river Amstel. We had a really warm welcome and Marrigje personally showed us around the spacious apartment. Her personal touch with fresh flowers, a nice fruit basket, a really good filled refrigerator, nice bottle of wine and nice paintings were everywhere. 
From the boat it takes about 15min to get downtown Amsterdam riding the bikes which are included.
Also riding the bikes along the Amstel is really nice.
We had a lovely weekend, and staying at Marrigje's place greatly contributed to that!"
3358926;20906148;2014-10-07;20553576;Tanja;Marrigje ist eine tolle Gastgeberin. Sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Hausboot war wirklich super. Sehr sauber, ein voller Kühlschrank,  frische Blumen und einen tierischen lieben Mitbewohner. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt, hatten ein tolles Wochenende und kommen gerne wieder!!!!
3358926;23160739;2014-11-24;22726686;Martin;"Een erg leuk appartement op een mooie, unieke, rustige en vooral leuke plek in Amsterdam. Het appartement is lekker ruim, ziet er keurig uit, is schoon en opgeruimd en is van alle gemakken voorzien. Het is heerlijk thuiskomen na een dagje Amsterdam. De rijkelijk gevulde koelkast maakt het helemaal af.
Met de fiets binnen 10 minuten in De Pijp en binnen 15 minuten in het centrum. Dus ook qua ligging en bereikbaarheid goed.
Wij komen zeker nog eens terug en raden het appartement van Marrigje zeker aan."
3358926;26692169;2015-02-17;26359674;Angela;We stayed at Marrigje's Water house with our 2 teenage sons, for a weekend.  It was ideal for us.  Marrigje and her family were welcoming  and helpful and totally unobtrusive.  The little kitchen was stocked with everything we needed for breakfast, and we even made supper out of it one evening when we were too tired to go out!  The bikes were a great way of getting into and around Amsterdam and great for working off the energy that built up during museum visits! The apartment was spotless, warm, comfy....I would recommend it+++

Marrigje took perfectely care of us. We just had bad luck with the weather and in this case it is a bit uncomfortable that the next public transport is quite a bit away. But with bicycle and nice weather its perfect and I can recommend to everyone who is looking for nice and quiet houseboat romantic."

Original et très sympa que cette location soit ainsi ""posée"" sur l'Amstel.

Es ist an alles gedacht im Appartment und der Kontakt mit Marrigje ist sowohl im Vorfeld wie auch vor Ort freundlich und unkompliziert. Die Strecke ins Zentrum ist sehr gut mit dem Fahrrad zu schaffen. Das Hausboot ist sehr zu empfehlen - das viele Wasser und Grün rundherum machen den Städtetrip super entspannt.

Very kind hosts.  After a long day of traveling it was nice to discover a full fridge with everything we needed to just relax and stay in and enjoy the gorgeous view! There was even wine, so appreciated!  It was decorated so lovely and I felt like I was inside a piece of art right down to the colorful fruit bowl.  The bed was the most comfortable ever.  LOVE!

3358926;72879051;2016-05-05;48669267;Klara;Wir wurden sehr herzlich von Mare und ihrer Familie empfangen.Das saubere Hausboot ist liebevoll eingerichtet und man fühlte sich gleich wohl. Über die Blumen, Obstteller und den gefüllten Kühlschrank haben wir uns sehr gefreut. Der Garten war gepflegt,schön bepflanzt, so wie auf dem Bild. Die Nachbarn grüssten freundlich. Dank Spaziergänge zur Tram (ca. 20 Min.) haben wir-trotzt üppigem Essen-nicht zugenommen. Die Krönung zum Abschluss: Der Hausherr fuhr uns mit seinem Auto zum Flughafen. Dieses Hausboot ist wirklich sehr empfehlenswert.
3358926;75567311;2016-05-22;53944374;Barbara;"Mare è stata estremamente cortese e disponibile nell'accoglierci, visto che il nostro volo è arrivato la mattina e ci ha permesso di prendere ""possesso"" delle bici e dell'appartamento appena atterrate!
L'houseboat è deliziosa, arredata con gusto e il frigo era pieno di cibo per la nostra colazione.
L'ubicazione della houseboat  è in una zona  tranquilla,  in un'ansa del fiume Amstel di grande pace. Fortunatamente noi abbiamo trovato un tempo clemente con qualche spiraglio di sole perché la casa si trova in una zona periferica, circa 15-20 minuti di distanza dal centro con le bici e in caso di pioggia battente potrebbe essere un problema.
nel complesso la nostra è stata una esperienza assolutamente positiva."
3358926;81921801;2016-06-25;27745760;Natasha;We had a great time staying here, can't complain about anything during our stay. We loved the water view and having the use of the bikes made our stay perfect! Would highly recommend! :-)
3358926;94440230;2016-08-15;3083170;Susan;Mare responded quickly with all communications, which makes things so much easier when you are making arrangements at a far away country.  She had everything just as described on the website.  Her mother was so helpful with everything from doing laundry for us to helping arrange a different bicycle when we needed it.  The best part was the bicycle trip Mare suggested to Ouderkerke de am Amstel, a beautiful little village to the south.
3358926;96681884;2016-08-23;12730377;Nadin;"The House boat is very nice, situated at the Amstel. The area is quiet and green and friendly. You can watch boats passing the house boat while having breakfast. The bedroom is really nice and has a own bathroom. The second bed's place is in front of the bedroom so you have it separate but you have to pass it in order to step out of the big bedroom. The kitchen is very small but well equipped for simple cooking/meals. 
Mare is the host and she is really kind!!! Short termed she organized a fifth bike for us. She fills the fridge with some things for breakfast and you will even find a bottle of good wine on the table. 
The house boat is about 15 minutes from the city centre by bike. For us Mares house boat was perfect, thanks a lot!"
3358926;100168479;2016-09-07;65357433;Karin;"Die Lage des Hausbotes war ruhig. Es wurde uns ein gutes Frühstück im Kühlschrank bereit gestellt.

3358926;122414472;2016-12-23;97636769;John;What a good find this was! Away from the city center but not too far, lovely and quiet with a great view over the Amstel. Everything clean and tidy, and the fridge stocked with breakfast - eggs, milk, butter, cheese, ham, marmalade - couldn't have asked for more. Easy to find, with free parking about 5 minutes walk away. 15 minutes walk to Metro (Spaklerweg) or 20 minutes to tramway. So you're in the city within 30 minutes but staying in a lovely quiet location. The houseboat was nice and warm, too - a must when visiting here in the wintertime as it gets cold and damp outside! Highly recommended, we'll be coming here again!
3358926;131689329;2017-02-13;36850036;Denise;We had a brilliant stay, everything was just as described the food left in the fridge was a nice surprise, houseboat was lovely and comfy watching the world go by.will be going back again hopefully
3358926;135457815;2017-03-05;61234009;Lea;We had a great stay at Mares. Everything was just as in the description and the Houseboat was super cozy! Can definitely recommend a stay here!
1497525;31957327;2015-05-12;10165054;Mélodie;Thijs and Aukje have a very nice apartment,faithful to the pictures. Everything was clean and they were very available for us, reachable all the time. By bus, the center is very close, and buses have a good frequency. By bikes, the center is only 10-15minutes away, it was a real plus to have the bikes lended with the apartment. Rocco is nice cat, always asking for cuddle. We recommend this apartment, you can book it with your eyes closed!!
1497525;78286516;2016-06-06;73702758;Matic;Loved the city and really lovely apartment. And the bikes are just perfect!
462809;4863976;2013-05-29;6126183;Tor;It's our first stay via Airbnb and we were a bit concerned with privacy and convenience. It was not the case at all. The room was nice and cosy, and we felt well taken care of. They could be reached easily, and respond promptly and kindly to our requests. Thank Julius and Janny for making our first visit to Amsterdam wonderful.
462809;24114100;2014-12-20;4090879;Nazehan;"Beautiful room. Has everything you need. Very good location; near to tram stations. Julius was there to greet us upon arriving & sent us off. All in all, i would recommend this place to anyone travelling to Amsterdam. Thanks for everything guys!"
462809;47342934;2015-09-18;20936264;Julianne;The room was wonderful, really soft bed. Umbrellas supplied! Most helpful considering the rainy weather. Our host was kind and friendly. The instructions provided on what trams to take were a lifesaver. Near two really cool bridges that are a must see in Amsterdam.
462809;57282591;2015-12-24;39586108;Julien;Appartement très agréable et bien agencé. Les 5 jours que nous avons passé furent très reposant, et les vélos proposés par Janny et son mari sont parfait pour une virée au centre d'Amsterdam.
462809;66358819;2016-03-22;8720107;Brandon;From the moment, we met Janny we knew our stay was going to be enjoyable. She was incredibly helpful from the very start and forthcoming with recommendations. Her room is just as she advertised and the view of the harbour is amazing. We hired bikes from Janny for 7.50 euros a day and it was the best choice we made despite the cold, wet weather. It was one of the best ways to explore the city. The room was clean and had heaps of light but black-out blinds block out the light if that is what you wish. Bed was very comfortable. There's also a stove for people to cook their own food.
462809;72862438;2016-05-05;58848686;Madelyn;Janny and Julius were kind enough to meet me at the train as I am a solo senior traveler with back issues.  I so appreciated this kindness and soon found this was typical of their personalities.  They went out of their way to help me have a wonderful stay in Amsterdam.  The apartment is cosy and well -located with shops, restaurants and tram access nearby.  It is in a quiet area away from tourist activities and being near the water was a bonus.   Julius was able to answer all my questions and they were many! I would highly recommend a stay with these lovely hosts.
462809;101349468;2016-09-12;64494269;Kerstin;It was a lovely little apartment in a quiet area. It's still very close to nice resturants and bars and it's very easy to get around, with public transport very close. The apartment had everything we needed for a short stay. Janny and Julius were very welcoming hosts.
462809;102726663;2016-09-18;30456833;Frank;Janny was there outside waiting for us and gave us the perfect introduction to our space. It should be noted that the room is very small. Everything is there that you need and it suited us fine for 3 nights and it is in a nice area but the room is essentially the bed. There is no space to walk around if this is a guest requirement. This is for information and not a criticism.
15750087;112436192;2016-11-06;101952659;Chloé;Très bon séjour, même si l'appartement est un peu excentré il y a des bus. L'appartement est super et Nick à été tres arrangeant.
15750087;127530164;2017-01-19;68261196;Anu;Well kept. Modern. Spacious. This place is a perfect place to relax a few minutes out of the main center of Amsterdam
2370505;26627885;2015-02-16;26870227;Karolina;"Carolien ist eine zauberhafte Gastgeberin. Wir wurden freundlich empfangen und hatten das Apartment das ganze Wochenende für uns. Die Lage ist fantastisch und perfekt vom Flughafen oder von der City zu erreichen. Eine super ausgestattete Küche bietet einem die Möglichkeit die Wohnung wie die eigene zu nutzen.

Wir empfehlen jedem ein Rad zu leihen. Man ist ganz schnell an allen wichtigen Orten und fühlt sich wie ein echter Holländer :) Den Dappermarkt (keine 5min zu Fuß von Carolien) solltet ihr nicht verpassen! Kulinarisch einfach unschlagbar !

Amsterdam hat sich von seiner besten Seite gezeigt. Wir kommen im Sommer definitiv wieder!"
2370505;29914119;2015-04-14;11283913;Alexandra Et Grégory;"Tout était parfait, l'appartement est vraiment comme sur les photos. 
Il est très fonctionnel et très proche des transports en commun. 
Un supermarché est également à proximité. 
Carolien est vraiment adorable et à disposition si nécessaire ! 
Encore merci pour votre accueil"
2370505;49810197;2015-10-06;24493136;Timothy;Clean, well contained. Close to public transport. Lovely host. We had a good time here.
2370505;54317985;2015-11-18;5790577;Terry;Caroline was most gracious. Her place was just as described.  Very comfortable and well furnished (cozy bed) with lots of light and sky.  Great Amsterdam location.  Moving in and out was simple.  Definitely recommended.
1473537;24734172;2015-01-02;16600126;Jeremy;Very cosy, comfortable and well equipped apartment in great location within easy walking distance of all the major sites. Reinoud was very helpful in making arrangements for my stay and responded promptly to emails. Would definitely recommend !
7557255;66400850;2016-03-22;22724808;Tomer;"The apartment was exactly as described: very neat, well-equipped, confortable and quiet.
We had a wonderful time and will surely choose this hostess and apartment at the next time we arrive to Amsterdam.
Thank you very much for this great experience - it was perfect!"
7557255;99758983;2016-09-05;58579044;Serge;Appartement très bien situé dans le centre d'Amsterdam. Très calme, très agréable au carrefour de 2 canaux, proche de commerces et des transports. Priscilla est très accueillante et précise dans ses renseignements. Ce fut une très agréable séjour...à refaire un jour.
1653777;12560389;2014-05-05;7370269;Jeremie;Koen is a very nice host. He gave more details and tips about his place and the area than I could have thought to ask and the logistics for the whole stay was perfect. Emails before the trip and chatting upon arrival made us feel very comfortable and indeed staying at Koen's place was a very good choice. The place itself is located by the beautiful Vondelpark and if you don't walk much, the tram is down the street to take you anywhere in town. The apartment is extra clean, stylish, and gets as much light as Amsterdam can offer. Go for it!
1653777;15701394;2014-07-14;1609071;Özgür;"We stayed 8 nights here in July. It's a good location - close to Vondel Park. We like walking, so by foot it's about 15 mins to Leidseplein. We arrived at night and    Koen's managed everything perfect even he wasn't in town! 

 The apt itself is clean, modern as has an great terrace to chill out in. Can say a good combination of being clean and well organized. Good shower, strong wifi and a well equipped kitchen. It is in a residential area- but also has some pubs and coffee shops but it doesn't disturb you noise wise.

All in all comfortable place to stay in Amsterdam : )"
12118316;73416505;2016-05-08;28157900;Neil;"Host delivered keys as arranged. Apartment was as described and is in a perfect location. It's very near to train and tram stations. There are many good bars and restaurants nearby.
I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit the city."
1174506;5466884;2013-07-01;6829331;Wendy;"The location is in a quiet neighborhood just one block from the main road. Roel's descriptions were exact. We were a short walk from Tram #4 which lead us to all the main stops we wanted to see (Rembrandtplein, Spui, & Dam to name a few). We were able to walk to the Rijkmuseum/Van Gogh Museum where the i AMsterdam sign is. 
The price was very reasonable, and Bob (the cat) was very friendly and low maintenance. 
I know everyone has their own preference when it comes to beds & pillows, but my husband and I found the bed to be very comfortable (soft) and the pillows were one of the best I've slept on (fluffy yet firm like memory foam).
Roel was very good with communicating any information and answering any questions I had. He set us up with instructions and offered his great selection of movies. 
Definitely a great trip due to a great place to stay!"
1174506;7018531;2013-09-03;7870404;Ben;"We really enjoyed our long weekend stay at Roel's apartment, it was ideally located for us in & amongst the best Amsterdam has to offer. 
Roel was very accommodating to our needs as we arrived early on the Friday, leaving late on the Sunday which was a great help to us.
On our arrival he gave us an 'idiots guide' for the apartment and local area of De Pijp which proved useful, he also left instructions on how to look after Bob, the cat who was adorable and very easy to care for.
The apartment is very stylish and representative of Roel's personality with quirky collections alongside a love for all things music, film & photography.
Overall we would highly recommend staying at Roel's house & we will look forward to visiting this wonderful City and staying here again."
1174506;13427068;2014-05-27;4677637;Manuela;"We stayed 4 nights at Roel's place and it was great. The appartment is beautifully furnished, Bob is the cutest and most easy-going cat ever, we instantly felt like at home! The area is awesome with a lot of nice shops, cafes and restaurants--and Roel provided a sheet with super-helpful recommendations. Coming back to Amsterdam we will always check back with Roel, and I can truly recommend that to everyone.

Thanks Roel--and Bob--for being such wonderful hosts!"
6017676;72158235;2016-05-01;12575563;Tijana;Ferline was very welcoming and kind, she arranged a meet upon our arrival,  gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. Her place is very clean, smells amazing, and is in a very quiet and beautiful neighbourhood. It is evident that she takes care of her gorgeous apartment, and she emailed me a couple of times during my stay to ensure that we were having a great time
7706472;53252889;2015-11-07;44583137;Francesco;Accoglienza buona, co ha lasciato cornetti per la colazione  e mappe per città e metro, l'annuncio (URL HIDDEN) quartiere è abbastanza tranquilo anche se un po fuori Amsterdam ma comunque ben collegato sia a metro e super mercati...
7706472;54107464;2015-11-16;43431790;Grace;Dearing and Kim were lovely. They met us at the apartment, and showed us around. Dearing even made sure to send directions for how to take the night buses if we were out later than the trams ran, which was very kind of him. The apartment was beautiful as pictured, and worked well for seven people to stay comfortably. It was also very close to the nearest train station, only about a five minute walk! Overall, we had a lot of fun and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
7706472;58499710;2016-01-03;10003895;Ena;We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam and the apartment was a really great one. Location is a bit outside of the city center, but the metro connection was great and really close to the apartment so that was not a problem for us. Apartment was lovely as on pictures, great view from the balcony and it also had some lovely touches like fresh tulips on the desk that made it even more warmer and nicer. Dearing and his wife are lovely hosts as well, they gave us all the necessary information about the transport, shops etc. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and hopefully we will come back again in the future.
7706472;59728143;2016-01-14;572783;Eva;We were met by Dearing at the apartment and made to feel very welcome, he even bought us croissants! The apartment is large, clean and has all that you need for a short stay in Amsterdam. Convenient to the metro, supermarket and just a matter of minutes to the centre of the city.
7706472;101420172;2016-09-13;70024025;Fiona;Thank you had a pleasant stay everything was ready for us. Was a distance from the centre of Amsterdam which we knew and it was very easy getting about with the Metro train station so close.  Thank you.
7706472;107851432;2016-10-12;47774021;Jaime;El apartamento está a las afueras de Amsterdam pero se encuentra muy bien comunicado por metro ya que la parada está a escasos 3 minutos a pie y te lleva directamente a la estación central. Tiene zona de aparcamiento público justo en frente del apartamento y no es difícil encontrar plaza. Se trata de un séptimo piso en un bloque de unas nueve plantas y a pesar de ser muchas viviendas nos pareció muy tranquilo y sin ruidos. La zona está rodeada por parques y jardines con grandes árboles y césped. El interior de la vivienda se ajusta a la descripción y aunque no posee grandes lujos está limpio y es suficientemente amplio para pasar unos días. La ducha es independiente del inodoro y tiene un cuarto que hacen servir de trastero. La parte negativa es la falta de armarios en los dormitorios, tampoco tiene TV ni horno ni microondas. Lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda.
7706472;129111597;2017-01-29;111771726;Pawlos;Metrostation in der Nähe der Wohnhng (ca. 3-5 Minuten). Von da aus alles erreichbar. Supermarkt auch direkt neben der Metro. Mit der Mertro kann man dann alles erreichen. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt. Einzige Mängel: Bisschen Staubig überall. Und die Waschbecken sind nicht sauber. Sonst Top
7706472;135449928;2017-03-05;9140314;Florencia;"The apartment is as shown in pictures. It is located in a quiet residential area and is close to the metro station. You can take the metro and get to the city center in about 20'. There are some stores nearby the metro station and a restaurant in front of it. 
The apartment itself was spacious and clean. The heating system worked very well. Dearing was a great host, very kind and helpful. He was waiting for us and explained everything we needed to know."
7111455;53414541;2015-11-08;38265694;Nidhi;Ellen and her husband were very helpful. There was a complete comfort and had a pleasant stay.
7111455;66984502;2016-03-26;23813641;Katja;liebe ellen, die drei Mädchen haben sich sehr wohlgefühlt, es hat ihnen gefallen, sie fanden dich sehr nett, vielen dank auch für den transport zum schiff, das ist nicht selbstverständlich. liebe grüsse, die Mutter Katja
7111455;80631151;2016-06-19;33552788;Kong;Ellen's place is exactly what you see on the pictures. The room with a private bathroom is clean, bright and spacious. The double bed is very comfortable that it well recharged my body battery during the 3-day travel. There is a fridge, a kettle and a microwave oven that allows simple breakfast in the room. Ellen's place is located at a suburban residential area up in the north, but it is connected to the city center by several buses (30-minute away from it). I didn't met Ellen in person but her husband Ron greeted me when I checked in. Ellen responded to my message quickly and offered clear direction and instruction. All in all it is a pleasant experience with Ellen.
7111455;97881066;2016-08-28;15800365;Emma;"We had a great time staying here. The room is cute and it's great that it's all self-contained. It's a cute and quiet part of Amsterdam that will give you an idea of a completely different area. The area near the ferry is also starting to boom - cute cafes, bars, restaurants, etc. 

Ellen was a lovely host and was in constant communication with us in the lead-up to and during our stay which was great. She even came and picked us up from the ferry!"
7111455;100671146;2016-09-10;1209633;Tony;"Ellen was a great host, charming and amenable, she went out of her way to make our stay a pleasant one. She was available on the phone to help when our GPS had problems finding the address and there to greet us on arrival. After she showed around the flat , explained how the public transport system works and providing us with chipkaarts she drove us  around the area a bit to get the lay of the land, giving us an impromptu tour of the northern docks area, explaining the various ferry service before depositing us at the free ferry to Centraal Station.

Ellen's place is in a quiet residential neighbourhood, mostly cute dutch houses; perfect if you're driving as we were, as there is good, safe and free parking right across the road; and even if you're not, the bus stops 50 metres from Ellen's front door and has you into Centraal Station in 25 mins or so. 

The accommodation itself was above expectations, I think Ellen is being modest in her description. Private, bright, spacious and well equipped with a particularly comfortable bed. 

We would most definitely stay here again."
7111455;112680163;2016-11-06;67717130;Rita;"Ellen y su marido son muy agradables. Antes de iniciar el viaje ya nos explicaron con todo detalle, como llegar desde el aeropuerto hasta su casa. La casa es tal cual las fotografías, la habitación acogedora, calentita, con microondas, cafetera, café,.. El día que llegamos Ellen nos explico las alternativas que teníamos para llegar 
hasta Ámsterdam. La casa está un poco alejada del centro, pero lo bueno es que está muy bien comunicada con Amsterdam, con bus y ferry, con lo cual el trayecto es sencillo y se te hace corto, y además así también ves como viven en los pueblos de las afueras. Zaandam es un barrio muy bonito. Solo tengo palabras buenas para dedicar a Ellen y a su alojamiento. Y Amsterdam es impresionante."
7111455;126366034;2017-01-11;44038477;Yumi;It's a nice room, spacious and clean. It is not near the central but it's convenient to take bus and a supermarket is nearby. The quiet and native neighbourhood is exactly what we want to experience. We didn't meet Ellen for she's not at home but we check in by ourselves and the room has all  facilities we need.
7111455;133667570;2017-02-24;36043899;Josef;The house is located far from the downtown, but you can take a direct connection (25min) to Amsterdam Centraal from the bus stop, which is really nearby. Also Lidl is so close. The room and its facilities are nice and comfy, we had a great stay at Ellen's and Ron's place.
3232023;24853691;2015-01-03;20840652;Emil;Everything was wonderful !!! Good location, very comfortable apartment, Stephan and Savitri are really beautiful people, they made everything to make our holiday in Amsterdam fantastic. I strongly recommend this apartment to everyone. Best you can get for such a reasonable price.
3232023;58035771;2015-12-31;47196246;Javier;"Very confy and lovely apartament! 
Very good comunication with them, unfortunatly, we have no met them.


Nice experience in Amsterdam!

Thank you"
16277898;132029706;2017-02-15;89999653;Sara;The apartment is on the last floor of the building and the stairs are very narrow so it's difficult to take your luggage up and down. A tv is listed in the amenities however it was not there, the black couch was also not there and was replaced by a single bed. The apartment is quite comfortable and spacious, bathroom is also nice and big. The location is good, it's very close to Albert heijn and also public transport. The actual host of the apartment was supposed to get in contact with me regarding the tv and a late checkout but never got back to me. Overall average experience.
14123993;102824064;2016-09-19;88910130;Stephanie;"Alla was a brilliant host! She was so accommodating to us even after a late arrival time due to flight issues. The place is perfectly located and has everything you need.

Would 100% recommend staying here, thank you Alla!"
14123993;103975229;2016-09-25;93604061;Enrico;The house is really nice and typical and the host is kind and helpful to every kind of questions and doubts. It is sited in the historical centre, in an area with good services. I'm looking forward to stay there again.
14123993;105464362;2016-10-02;33257232;Marion;Alla's place is perfectly located next to everything. As there are many pubs and discos in the street it can be a bit noisy the night but personnally I slept well. Alla was very nice and let us in the appartment late in the afternoon the last day. So I would definitely recommand this place.
14123993;111378907;2016-10-31;20466303;Vanessa;"Io e il mio fidanzato abbiamo soggiornato da Alla tre notti,  ci siamo trovati molto bene in quanto la casa è in centro, vicina ai servizi e alla vita notturna di Amsterdam, ristoranti, bar e coffeshop si trovano praticamente sotto casa. Alla è stata disponibilissima dal momento della prenotazione risponde velocemente ai messaggi e la casa è esattamente come descritta, adatta per due persone. È stata anche molto disponibile per il check-in in quanto il nostro aereo è arrivato in ritardo. 
Consigliatissima, quando tornerò ad Amsterdam tornerò sicuramente ad alloggiare qui! 
Baci baci"
15783317;120989926;2016-12-13;92631023;Emily;I am so happy to choose this apartment as my first stay in the trip.We enjoyed a lot at James' house,and we like the house so much! ^_^ Clean and comfortable. Jennie is also a very nice and friendly host. I would definitely like to stay longer next time. ^_^
14021349;101613555;2016-09-14;51714775;Morten;Fantastick appartment! Big and nicer than the pictures. The bathroom was the nice and that doesn't even show at the pictures. Nice neighborhood. David was very easy to communicate with and made the stay comfortable for us. He respond to any questions very quickly. We would love to come back!
14021349;107275127;2016-10-09;1594071;Kahlia;"I did not get to meet David, but we had a few great chats on the phone. And it was clear David was really hospitable & eager that my group & I enjoy his fab apartment. 
The location is in a trendy, warehouse-y part of the city, near some cool bars, close to the water, yet also very residential/local. The down side is it's less easy to get into the city centre than being in other parts of Amsterdam. We tended to get Ubers than public transport. 
The apartment has real wow factor, once you open the upstairs door. It's very industrial chic, with so much character - interesting lighting, furnishings and little chill-out zones. It would be perfect for 4 people, as there are 2 main bedrooms, and only one bathroom & toilet. However, we were a group of 7, and it suited us fine. There is so much social space, it's fantastic. We used David's extra airbeds & couch space, and were perfectly comfy for bedding (though more than 2 nights might have been pushing it). 7 people also put a little strain on the bathroom, but it was fine. 
The apartment is unique, which we loved, as it gave us an insight into Dave- the-host, like the bath/bonsai. But some of the features may not be suited to everyone's taste. For example the lighting is very (very) ambient in the bedrooms due to a lack of overhead lighting (thus, all lit by lamps/low watt feature bulbs) and there are no curtains anywhere (so eye-masks are necessary for hangovers and light sleepers). 
Overall, we could't have asked for a better place for our group."
1686654;8388558;2013-10-28;9266977;Jérôme;Great place, very nice. I really enjoy my stay
1686654;12907403;2014-05-13;15037127;Nada;"Ingrid is a very helpful and kind person! I am glad to have been able to meet her as it appears most of the time guests do not. The apartment is spectacular -definitely better than the photos reveal (and the photos are already beautiful.. so imagine!). The perfect mixture of old and modern. The location is great; on the famous Albert Cuyp Marketstreet and walking distance from the Museum Quarter. I am a light sleeper however and as the bedroom faces the street, I was woken up every day by the setting up of the market stalls. My  boyfriend did not have the same problem as me and it did not matter much anyway as we tried to get up bright and early most days. Fantastic experience with a fantastic host! When we come back to Amsterdam, I do hope to book Ingrid's gorgeous apartment again!"
1686654;15320861;2014-07-07;15464118;Sarah;We loved our stay at Ingrid's place. The apartment was bright indeed, well equipped and clean. The sofa bed was very comfortable. The location was great, away from tourist traps, in De Pijp which is ideal for restaurants and bars. The apartment is located on the market street, they start setting up at 6.30am which was a problem for me because i am a light sleeper, my friends didn't hear anything. All in all, i would highly recommend staying here, i will do it again, i will just buy earplugs!
1686654;17937571;2014-08-19;3790672;Ellie;We had a great time staying at Ingrid's lovely flat. It was well located, near the museum quarter and with lots of cool bars and restaurants around the corner. The flat itself was great - clean, modern and well set up for visitors. Highly recommend! Thanks for a wonderful stay!

La rue est très vivante et les jours de marché il vaut mieux les boules quies (bouchons d'oreilles) si on ne veut pas se lever à 7h ou 8h. Les soirées sont très calmes car les bars sont au coins de la rue. 
Il y a plein de bars et restos et plein de commerce et même 2 supermarchés dans le quartier, la utrechtstraat à 2 pas pour des boutiques sympa. Et surtout les TRAM menant au centre ville sont tout près et on arrive à la gare centrale très facilement. 
Ingrid est disponible en cas de besoin et très agréable. 
Nous avons passé un excellent séjour."

The area is full of nice bars and restaurants.
I would not hesitate to stay again if I found myself in Amsterdam!"
708528;80710104;2016-06-19;54529421;James;"Jeremie & Amber were excellent hosts. They were attentive and easy to contact if anything did come up. The apartment was beautifully clean and the location was just perfect. De Pijp is such a lovely area with more than enough to keep you occupied. 

Highly recommended."
708528;112870714;2016-11-08;97217875;Alessandro;Prima della partenza Amber ci aveva già dato indicazioni precise su come raggiungere l'appartamento (a pochi metri dalla fermata del tram). E' stato molto facile e abbiamo ricevuto un'ottima accoglienza. Nell'appartamento ci aveva anche lasciato dei biglietti da visita e delle mappe sui luoghi di interesse. Ulteriormente ci hanno lasciato il necessario per la prima colazione (tè, caffè, marmellata, succo di frutta e latte) e il giorno dopo ci hanno lasciato pane fresco e croissant fuori alla porta. L'appartamento era pulitissimo, ampio, bello e situato in una zona non distante dal centro storico, con molti bar e ristoranti dove concludere la serata, eppure  non affollata dai turisti. Amber è stata molto gentile nell'accoglierci e abbiamo goduto al meglio il nostro breve soggiorno a Amsterdam.
708528;116310128;2016-11-29;25599671;Amelia;Great location, great place that has everything that you could need, very clean and comfortable! Hosts are very responsive and available!
708528;139725050;2017-03-26;9918915;Marlene;The studio is super comfortable, very well located and its hosts, excellent people! They even provided amazing breakfast, from a local bakery shop, for our stay.
847730;51353047;2015-10-19;44581176;Erik;This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was definitely an auspicious one! Leoni made herself available for communication immediately and remained in close contact with me throughout the duration of my stay. Although I never heard her voice, it was obvious that she is a warm, friendly, and upbeat host. She gave clear instructions for our stay and thoughtful suggestions for what to do. The apartment was as described, if not better than what I was expecting. The quiet neighborhood and beautiful Erasmus park were refreshing to come back to. My friend and I felt very lucky to find this listing!
847730;63967642;2016-02-28;35221958;Patricia;"Le logement correspondait parfaitement à l'annonce.
Appartement spacieux, lumineux et au calme.
On se sentait comme à la maison.
Leoni nous avait laissé des adresses de bars et restaurants."

This has been,without a doubt, the best experience I've ever had with air bnb and a host ! Incredible location great help from this hosts ( including cheat sheet with the perfect info, and after an amazing talk, more info and amazing suggestions ) and the most amazing neighborhood that is so close to the center yet away from all the craziness of the tourist filled parts! And what a beautiful apartment ! Highly recommended !!!!

If you're up to rent something on Amsterdam, i advise you to call Franz! Very nice, helpful and welcoming host! 
Thanks again"

We sadly didn't get to meet Esther or Jan, but the staff in Cafe Kobalt were wonderful and were available throughout our stay to help with whatever we needed. The apartment was great and full of charm.

A perfect apartment, perfect location, perfect stay!"

Kobalt café downstairs is an ideal meeting point (and breakfast place) for a group of +/- 8 people."
510836;19361973;2014-09-11;17451572;Nicoletta;"Buongiorno,
siamo un gruppo di 15 persone appena rientrate da Amsterdam.
L'appartamento è molto carino, in pieno centro e comodissimo perchè a due passi dalla stazione e dai principali centri di interesse.
Forse ma , nel nostro caso è solo un problema di numeri, mancavano asciugamani e coperte necessarie per tutti gli ospiti ma , non essendo per niente freddo, fortunatamente non abbiamo avuto bisogno delle coperte; il personale di accoglienza è stato gentile e disponibile; ci sarebbe piaciuto essere accolti dai proprietari come normalmente succede in Italia per avere uno scambio direttamente con loro ; nel complesso la casa e i servizi sono pienamente soddisfacenti ed Amsterdam fantastica!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gruppo La Spezia, settembre 2014"
510836;28859920;2015-03-31;20805384;Amanda;The apartment was very clean and in a fantastic area, well worth a visit. Friendly staff.
510836;30275385;2015-04-20;21761863;Simran;The girls said they had a brilliant stay - the apartment was lovely and in a great location. The manager of the cafe was very accommodating! Thank you very much for a great stay
510836;33060907;2015-05-25;23119921;James;Firstly, Esther and Jan are superb hosts. They made everything easy all through the process. They communicated perfectly and were always available to answer queries. They really wanted our stay to be enjoyable. The apartments are superb and perfectly located. All of the key tourist spots are a short walk away. There is a great bar/cafe on the ground floor of the building and the staff were great. They handled check in and out and made sure they we had everything we needed. I would highly recommend these apartments and plan to return.
510836;61018501;2016-01-31;8516105;Dave;Had a wonderful stay with our team. Very nice apartment in a superb location. Downstairs there is the Kobalt Inn where you can have a delicious breakfast. Tram is close by to reach all the locations in Amsterdam. Neighbourhoud offers good restaurants, bars etc as well.
510836;64756401;2016-03-08;47486834;Kristin;Jan & Esther were lovely and provided us with all necessary informations, they took great care and the fact that you could ask the staff at the cafe everything was great.
510836;72809690;2016-05-04;52298454;Hayley;"I've just come back from 3 nights in the Combo Apartments and have had the most amazing time. The apartments are stunning and in such a perfect location with views over the canal.
We had a large group, 9 of us, and the two apartments were more than big enough. One of the main things I wanted out of our stay was to have communal seating areas rather than multiple separate hotel rooms, and the Combo Apartments definitely gave us just that with living rooms in each apartment.
I highly recommend staying here if you have a larger group, or if a smaller group just renting one of these gorgeous apartments. If I come back to Amsterdam I will definitely be looking to stay in these apartments again."
510836;103764061;2016-09-24;47320432;Federico;"I stayed here with my friends for 9 nights and we absolutely loved the accommodation. Jan and Esther are really friendly and very easy to get in touch with. They replied immediately to any question we had and have been extremely helpful with everything. They sent us very detailed information on how to get there from the airport, and were extremely accommodating even if we got there late because of a delayed flight. Jan met us in person for checking in and showed us around, giving plenty of information on the accommodation but also on Amsterdam.

The accommodation is in a very central location, ten minutes walk from the main square, but also very conveniently located five minutes walk from the main train station. Getting there from the airport is extremely easy, and visiting Amsterdam is even easier. Most things are at walking distance, and the train station is also a major bus/tram stop so everything can be reached really easily.

The accommodation is very spacious and has everything that you might need. It's clean and very comfortable. Kitchen facilities are new and the living area is great for relaxing, including a nice TV. Bedrooms are nice with big and comfortable beds.

I can only recommend staying here - we had a great time and everything was as described. Jan and Esther were always in touch during our stay checking that everything was going well. They also provided guide books in the accommodation so that we could look up where to go during our stay."
2025900;64852208;2016-03-08;58355778;Leonardo;"I spent 4 nights in the house and I had a great time. The apartment is cozy and warm, you can reach the center by bus in 15 minutes. Naomi's friend was very king, she left us a list of useful tips. Check in and check out times are flexible and the host takes care of every particular.
Perfect spot to spend a few nights abroad and to relax yourself."
9772693;61809060;2016-02-08;3253713;Joanne;Jeanet and her home were lovely and welcoming. The house is very pretty and well equipped with everything you could need for your stay. Jeanet gave us good information on the local facilities and the property itself is walking distance from the centre. We had a really nice time, thank you.
9772693;75919731;2016-05-23;12704678;Lidia;Janet è stata molto simpatica e accogliente. La casa è molto pulita e rispecchia esattamente le foto. Si trova in un quartiere molto tranquillo, appena oltre il fiume. Il centro è raggiungibile in 15 minuti a piedi. Sicuramente se avremo modo di tornare ad Amsterdam torneremo da Janet. Grazie.
15794631;130234079;2017-02-05;4693802;Christi;Book this place now!!!! It was even more spacious than it looks in the photographs. Very quirky Dutch style staircases so if you have any mobility issues or huge suitcases be aware of that. 3 of us stayed very comfortably, the place is brand new and super clean and well taken care of. Great showers and comfortable beds, and the second powder room is also great with multiple guests. The area is close to the tram to central Amsterdam, and it's positioned right on a canal which is just stunning! We loved everything about this place and can't wait to book again.
8475898;127562292;2017-01-19;25467121;Mathieu;The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
421171;3980228;2013-04-01;5268097;Daniela;They were extremely nice. The house was impeccably clean and beautifully modern-styled. The room is on the ground floor and they live upstairs. The toilet is in a separate room from the shower which is convenient. Fairly close to the city center, just a few stops on the tram away. The room we stayed in can definitely fit 3 people. Could even fit 4 people if you don't mind squeezing 3 on the bed. The bed is fairly big. That's what we did and we all slept VERY well. Would highly recommend staying here.
421171;4167242;2013-04-15;5631913;Stefany;"The house is located in a friendly and peaceful neighborhood right outside of Amsterdam. The tram stop just on the corner of the street is a great plus.
Simone and Boris have a very vibrant, modern and cosy home which perfectly reflects the way they are.
They were very friendly and helpful, but not pushy at all as they let us to our own privacy. The provided utilities in the room are just what you would need to prepare your own quick breakfast or lunch.
Great place to stay for a short getaway weekend or for a longer period of time."
421171;4391881;2013-05-02;5205600;Moniek;"We stayed in this room for the Queensday weekends as 2 friends.
Would surely recommend this place. I liked it very much that they had the equipment to make some breakfast or lunch. You can easily connect to the city center with tram, bike or walking or go for a walk at Slotervaart plas. (A nearbye lake).
You will have the privacy you need, since the room and a sink is downstairs. Besides that Simone and Boris are always open for a chat or questions. Could not think of any improvement, so as said before... do not wait too long before booking."
421171;4653993;2013-05-18;2286123;Mass & Matt;Our experience at Simone & Boris's place, has been fantastic! You really feel like at home, lots of comfort, close to the center and easy to get to. Simone & Boris are amazing host and ready to help, advice and answer every questions you have. If you going to Amsterdam, stay here :-)
421171;12367174;2014-04-30;6108943;Anne;We had a great stay at this beautiful apartement! We only met Boris and he was very cordially, we enjoyed his warm welcome and a high degree of privacy. The bed was very comfortable, we had a fridge, a coffee machine, towels, WLAN and everything else we needed. We would definitely stay again, thank you Simone & Boris!
421171;62457807;2016-02-14;5631888;Stephanie;Boris and Simone´s room is very functional and with a charm. We stayed there over the weekend and had a really nice time. Although we didn´t get to meet, they provided some recommendations and made us feel at home. If you stay for a very short time, it might be worth to stay closer to the centre -especially to go back at night. All the rest was perfect! Thanks.
421171;92449491;2016-08-08;37794210;Lauren;Our stay with Boris and Simone was excellent. We were pleased with how close it was to both tram and metro. The tram into central Amsterdam is about 20 minutes but the journey is very pretty. Simone was very welcoming and explained where everything was. There were some very helpful maps and a very yummy gift left by Simone. The room was clean and exactly as described. A really, really lovely stay, we really enjoyed our holiday. Thank you :)
421171;125166478;2017-01-04;74317893;Stefanie;Alles in allem super! Mit der Tram 2 ist man in 20min in der Innenstadt und bei allen bekannten Sehenswürdigkeiten. Boris ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Wir kommen gerne wieder. :)
10980092;74578315;2016-05-15;35008347;Shana;Kim was heel vriendelijk en gastvrij. De buurt was hip en levendig.
10980092;83471002;2016-07-03;421182;Frédéric;Kim était absente lorsque j'ai occupé son logement. Néanmoins une bonne organisation a permis un séjour sans problème. J'ai récupéré ses clés chez une amie. Le logement n'a aucun cachet particulier et n'est pas d'une propreté parfaite.  Le quartier est sympa, avec plein de bars, de restaurants et d'animations. Il est à 30-45 minutes du centre ville ce qui permet une bonne promenade dans Amsterdam.  Toutefois j'ai trouvé la nuitée chère par rapport au logement : 90 € par nuit.
10980092;89842650;2016-07-30;49371651;Amanda;Kim was a lovely host, she met me at the tram station even though it was 10.45pm when I arrived. The room was nice and spacious, the bathroom was small but functional and clean. Great location in a nice part of town, close to museums and short tram to central Amsterdam. Only small issue was the Internet connection struggled making calls ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)/FaceTime) but otherwise worked well. Highly recommend!
8903636;56788721;2015-12-18;48588561;Sheree;Had a great stay in Amsterdam. Location of the apartment was perfect. Really added a personal touch to stay in an apartment instead of a hotel. Will definitely return to Amsterdam again.
8903636;71469053;2016-04-25;38773227;Lionel;Accueil sympathique et appartement au top et tres bien situé! Merci!
2086724;12121167;2014-04-23;12793142;Céline;I spend 4 days here and have a nice experience. The room is comfortable and the breakfast is nice. Giovanni is very kind and patient to explain everything to me. He has prepared the transport card for us. It is convenience for us. Besides that, he has prepare a iPhone for us. It is helpful to move around in the city. I'll definitely stay at his place when i return to Amsterdam.
2086724;12407062;2014-05-01;13561682;Steven;Bureau was the best host, he was extremely accommodating, always asking for suggestions on how to improve the stay for his guests and we couldnt even think of any.  The apartment itself is great, excellent view with really comfortable beds and in a very nice area of town (about 20 min walk from city center which was a nice walk or a 5 min bus ride).  Would definitly recommend it.
2086724;12533708;2014-05-05;12384246;Claudia;"Es war ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt, Giovanni war sehr freundlich und hat uns gut umsorgt. Für das Frühstück waren reichlich Früchte, Brot und alles was das Herz begehrt vorhanden. Kleiner Tipp: Nehmt eine Schlafmaske mit, die Zimmer haben keine Vorhänge und man wird am frühen Morgen von der Sonne geweckt :-) Für einen Städtetripp ideal. Man ist in ca. 30 min zu Fuss im Zentrum, Bus fährt direkt vor dem Haus. 
Claudia"
2086724;21037824;2014-10-10;20299430;Daniel;"My experience at Giovanni's place was great! I arrived and around 2pm and he was there to greet me. He then showed me to my room and around the apartment.  

The kitchen features:
A quick and easy coffee machine, juicer, blender, and anything else you could need for a morning beverage. 
There is plenty of fresh fruit and cereal for all of your breakfast needs. 
The kitchen also features a pantry with plenty of goods and spices to remind you of your own home.
Note: there is no oven (didn't bother me at all)

The bedroom:
The bed comes as advertised! That is one of the most comfortable beds I've spelt on in my life. Honestly, you could rent the room on the bed alone and be content.  
The only complaint I had about the room was the wind, however, it didn't affect my sleep. It just affected my ability to smoke.
Note: the room comes with a key so your stuff will be safe

Extras:
He has amazing bikes that are free to use. His place comes with a washer and dryer. The iPhone was an amazing bonus! (it can get confusing in the city)

Overall:
I would recommend this b&b! Great way to meet other travelers"
2086724;22934450;2014-11-17;8665056;Marco;Unbelievable room and experience... Perfect solution for your visit to Amsterdam city centre.   Giovanni has done a perfect organisation for all the guests with bicycle, iPhone and transportation cards.  Really good job. His house is wonderful.
2086724;31028732;2015-05-01;16978825;Samantha;What I loved about about the listing was the location. Very close to central amsterdam. Also it looks exactly like the pictures and the bed is very comfortable. My favorite part was the use of the bikes that they provide you. Definitely take advantage of using the bikes we had a lot of fun.
5604637;33003162;2015-05-24;32002221;Melida;The apartment was nice and cozy. I roomed with my classmate and it was great having separate beds. It's a quiet neighborhood and having the park right in front was amazing. Also, having access to Netflix was great after a long day in the center and the Internet works great.
5604637;33450207;2015-05-28;31435537;Ngaio;"A very relaxing apartment overlooking the park! The neighbour was nice and quiet, kids playing on the street etc, very welcoming.
Our host was very responsive, helpful and welcoming, especially as we were delayed arriving.
Public transport, shops and amenities are all close by.
The place was very clean and tidy and having a full kitchen is great, the bed was also very comfortable and we slept very well!
Would happily stay again."
5604637;42950837;2015-08-16;40439208;Mark;"This was our first AirBnB experience, and it confirmed what our daughter told us - it's the way to travel. If you want to feel as if you live in the city you're visiting, I recommend it, and if you're going to Amsterdam with 1-2 others, I would recommend Mr. Narhi's apartment. Everything was as described. Lovely apartment. Bath and kitchen spotless and so easy to use. Fine view of street and Rembrandt Park from bay window. Dining table in front of bay window makes for relaxing and pleasant meals, and windows on both sides of apartment give good cross ventilation. Apartment is on quiet street beside the Park (we're ""mature"" adults, so the quiet was most appreciated). Easy access to tram lines into city center. WiFi was also much appreciated. We were met by Mr. Narhi's friend (he had to be out of town), who patiently waited over an hour for us to arrive and then showed us the apartment, making us feel very welcome, answering all our questions and giving us several useful tips on seeing the city. I would like to emphasize the convenience of the apartment to the city center (a five minute walk to the tram line and a 5-7 minute ride to the center of the city - excellent trams), and the comfort of the apartment. We cooked our own breakfasts (small grocery stores a few minutes walk away), made lunches to take with us, and simply felt so very much at home. Thank you, Mr. Narhi, and thank your dear friend, Ms. Muirhead, for all her kind help.  I would choose to stay at your place again in a heartbeat."
5604637;47058164;2015-09-15;18941319;Joshua;Ilkka was a great host, he was kind enough to pick us up from the airport even after we had arrived an hour and a half later than scheduled! He was also helpful picking out some restaurants and cafes close to the apartment. The apartment itself was amazing, big and spacious and a nice surrounding area, it had everything we needed for our stay and was just a ten min tram ride into central so great location. Really enjoyed our stay and would certainly book again.
5604637;82672395;2016-06-28;67302956;Roman;"Mr. I.T. greeted and welcomed me and my sister personally and showed us around his place and explained all questions we asked considering the use of things in the flat and options around the neighbourhood.

The flat was equiped with machines and infrastructure equipment, which worked flawlessly just the as one would expect from home. Very well maintained and very pleasant place to stay.

During our stay he made good recommendations through chat on what possibilities there are around the neighbourhood.

We had an external issue that was not within his control and possibilities to handle, yet he helped me very quickly to bypass and solve it, so that we still had a splendid stay at his place.

Overall and on all points, hats off to Mr. I.T. He is a very welcoming, honest person and his place is wonderful. The neighbourhood is quite pleasing with many possibilities and options for many tastes and preferences.

Thumbs up! Very recommended! Thank you very much, Mr. I.T. ;)"
13255105;107574614;2016-10-11;93650846;Craig;Eva & Kobe were excellent and the apartment exceeded our expectations.   I would definitely recommend both this property and Eva & kobe as airbnb managers.  We had a great time in Amsterdam!

The apartment was better than it appeared in the pictures. Very clean, organized, and did I mention clean?  The windows opened completely allowing a nice breeze to come into the place which was very nice since it was warm during my stay. The apartment had a nice welcome note which was also very helpful. The place is located in a very nice neighborhood which seems to be closer to where locals live. I appreciated being able to escape the ""crowd"" of tourists and relax in a neighborhood bar a after a long day of lines and questionable tourist hygiene. I knew it was a great stay when I didn't want to leave (seriously)."
10198226;73615025;2016-05-09;52975625;Jamie;Upon arrival Zidan did not have the room ready but we were able to leave our bags. The place is right in the heart of the red light district. Great for partying but not great for a good nights sleep due to noise. The ad says 4 beds but it is only 2 which around both fold outs. The room is small, fine for 2 people. Zidan was quite slow at communicating and was late when we were checking out. He also asked for a 50 euro cash deposit which is actually outside of Airbnb policy. Overall a great stay but have had better places in Amsterdam
10198226;91636144;2016-08-06;30663137;Tobias;The Location is great! Unbeatable. There was one bad thing to mention: old sheets! Mattress was dirty. Bring your own sheets and you will be alright.
562179;1902292;2012-08-06;2846444;Leigh;This is a nice flat in a great location, the owner is easy to contact and responsive. The flat I would say is not a real 2 bedroom as you have to pass through the first bedroom to the second which may be awkward. As such it is probably a little dear.

Also Xiong always responded very quick and provided very useful information, thanks a lot"
761411;15452686;2014-07-09;130331;Megan;Xiong was travelling while I stayed at his place, but I had a good experience nonetheless. Coordinating check-in and check-out The location was excellent (only a 20-minute bus ride to Central Station), but those visiting Amsterdam for the first time may want to be closer to the action. The apartment was spacious, quiet and clean, as advertised. I also appreciated the use of the full kitchen. Grocery stores and bus lines are also nearby, and the surrounding area has a beautiful bike/walking path nearby.
761411;16082272;2014-07-22;2313594;Jean Marc;"Thé apartment was equipped, clean and not far from thé city center.
I am very satisfied."
761411;17935423;2014-08-19;6586884;Szabina;"Clean, quiet and safe, just as promised. It is a perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. You can easily get out from the noise of the city and surrounded by rabbits and birds, but still stay in the circulation and any time get back to the life of Amsterdam's centre.
Xiong is an excellent host, giving a lot of useful information and tips, arranging well arrival and so on. Other hand he is not just a good host but a very nice guy whom I had nice discussion into the night. It was like, we would share the apartment for longer time, I did not expect for such a good atmosphere I got. Thank you Xiong and I hardly recommend his place  if you want to stay in Amsterdam clean, quiet and safe. :)"
761411;23839520;2014-12-12;8526157;Sofie;I have stayed here in the past and will stay here again in the future. It is a really nice place to stay when you visit Amsterdam. It's not in the city center but the public transport is convenient. It's quiet and clean. Xiong is a nice host and easy to communicate with.
761411;24860598;2015-01-03;24116230;Younes;Appartement idéal pour un petit séjour a Dam a 15 min du centre ville en bus juste a cotés de la résidence trés bon standing au bon prix Xiong est très sympathique et attentionné merci
761411;26406990;2015-02-11;22169035;Soojung;"Host, Xiong is one of the best hosts I have had with Air B&B.
Very quick at responding, and attentive.  
Place is clean and cozy and easy to access. 
Even though not in the center of Amsterdam, it's quite close and easy to get to all the tourist attractions in Amsterdam. 
All in all I can recommend to stay here."
761411;45621577;2015-09-04;1233458;Jordan;Although I didn't get to meet Xiong (he was away on business) he communicated very well and I always felt up to date with what I needed to know. Reina (who is one of Xiong's neighbours) gave me the key and showed/explained everything to me very clearly. The place was very clean, the bed was comfortable and I slept well. Location for me (because I was with my car) was also very good and only 15mins into the centre. The ONLY thing I could say is that I appreciate completely that through Airbnb it is not a hotel and that you should treat it as if you would expect someone to treat your house. Having said that, by using Airbnb the prices are often similar to hotel rates so it's also your choice to do it to make an income, so there needs to be a bit of a balance. I feel Xiong was perhaps a bit too tight with some rules (perhaps has had bad experiences in the past) particularly with the usage of an iron/ironing board. Anyone travelling for business will need to neaten their clothes and to say, it's my house not a hotel, how many homes do not have an iron/ironing board? Anyway, that is the only negative so if you are just looking for a quiet, clean place to relax and visit Amsterdam, especially if you are with the car, I can fully recommend this place and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Thanks for a great stay!
761411;51974600;2015-10-25;46104445;Jamie;"The room was very nice, so was the whole apartment. We were allowed to use basically anything (TV, microwave, stove, etc.).

We didn't get to meet Xiong, but his neighbour lady Reina showed us everything and gave us a key.

It is very easy to get to the centre of Amsterdam (5min walk + 20min bus). There is also a supermarket and a shopping centre close to the apartment.

It's definitely a very nice place to stay, not only for a short time, but also for longer."

Everything was as expected even better. The accommodation was clean, well organized and just ready for starting our holiday. Thx to you Danny, you and you place made us a great New Year... 
We would call it an insider!!!"

The suite is very very big with two big doors that takes to a small and beautiful garden where  is possible to see many types of birds( that will nicely wake you up in the morning!!!) the bathroom has a bathtub and a big window and the pavement is heated(another plus). The furnitures and all the decoration is genuine. The apartment looks nicer than the pictures can show. The position is great. The street is very calm, but you just turn the corner and you find bars and restaurants and Amstel river. 5 minutes walking till the tram stop(another 8 min with the tram to get to museum area and Leidseplein ). 3 minutes walking till intercontinental Amstel hotel, where beautiful  and important people from Amsterdam goes for the happy hour and if you want to live a part of this , with only 36€ you can have a dream breakfast with a stunning Amstel view. Very nice everything !!"
1776018;73067956;2016-05-06;25657185;Carol;This is a very special house in Amsterdam  Lot and Camiel have a beautiful ground floor apartment with a garden area off the bedroom  They left us a very nice treat of cheese, wine, bread, fruit and cake which we very much appreciated.  The apartment is about a 20 minute to the Rijks and van Gogh museums which was great.  There are also a number of buses and trams a couple blocks away which will take you to the tourist sites.  The apartment has all the amenities that you would expect in your own home.  The wifi worked very well and there is a book left with information on restaurants, grocery shops etc which much appreciated.   We felt very welcome in their home and would hope to return in the future.  Thanks Lot and Camiel

We were so glad that TV was replaced with very quality music and plenty of great books and games.

We definitely recommend this appartment :)"

Jurrian's friend met us and provided all the linen and towels. The studio is equipped with all dishes and cutlery. 
Even though the studio is very small it is a great deal for such a money for a couple. It is perfectly ok to spend there more than couple of nights."
12507833;75333064;2016-05-20;15424715;Alejandra;Our experience in Amsterdam was excellent. Not only did Kobe and Eva picked us up from the airport, they also welcomed us with beer, sweets, and a nice birthday message. They also provided valuable information about the city as well as Belgium. We would have loved to stay longer. Until next time and many thanks!!
12507833;92363601;2016-08-08;15781197;Grégory;"Eva & Kobe are great hosts since our arrival with welcome snacks. They helped us with the information of the city.
 
The apartment was cozy and nicely decorated. We have spent a very good stay in family.

The metro is very close. We were a few minutes of downtown. There is a shop a few blocks and we recommend coffee Lokkal to spend some very good breakfasts and brunch."
12507833;100716736;2016-09-10;63613215;Corey;"Eva & Kobe blew our minds with their hospitality and helpfulness. Upon arrival, they provided us with a quick ""Get to Know Amsterdam"" manual with places to go, foods to try, and tips to get around the city.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday and our one year anniversary, and they were so kind that they left us a bottle of wine and snacks to get our vacation going. The apartment was beautiful, well decorated, modern, and clean.  It was also close to city transportation.  I'd like to comment on the updated finish out of the bathroom and shower, very nice!"

We couldn't of asked for more and Kobe even gave us a lift to the airport for our early return flight which was extremely kind!"
1784824;15150558;2014-07-03;8219658;Alexandra;Cosy and creative space with amazing roof terrace. Everything was well-kept and lovely when we arrived. It's just 7-10 min by tram or 20 min of nice walking to the city center. A lot of food stores, cafes and everything you need in the area. I highly recommend Annemarie as a friendly and heplful host and her flat to truly experience and enjoy visiting Amsterdam.
1784824;19682047;2014-09-16;19515909;Jean Marc;"Anne Marie flat is very nice place for a stay in Amsterdam.
Well equiped, very convenient for transportation. And the roof is a real plus, as the weather was  sunny. (great view also)

The place is charming, mix of ancien amsterdam style and modern design touch. 
It is perfectly equiped, wifi, etc, even Netflix is available.
It is also very quiet, and combined with the confortable and large bed, it makes a very resting place at night. (so important for my business trip).

Anne Marie is a very attentive host, and she arranged very convenient details for the keys for me.

She also provided a hair dryer and  fresh towels. and nice details that makes the difference. (plus a AC power adapter in case, plus coffee capsules that saved my days, a list of nice places to go for lunch or grocery, a delicious welcome present and a few fresh fruits, ..)

I will definitely ask her for a new stay in case i go there,  or recommend her flat to friends."
1784824;26596151;2015-02-16;24654558;Jack;Annemarie is a fantastic host, helping us massively by giving us tips and hints about the city, and key collection was very easy. The apartment was exactly as we expected it to be from the photos, fantastic location for accessing the city both daytime and for the nightlife. The roof terrace was especially nice offering good views and somewhere else to sit even though it was winter! We are already planning our second trip back in the summer, couldnt recommend it more.

11094104;71500579;2016-04-25;5033390;Emily;We loved staying in Michiel's gorgeous studio apartment.  We arrived late on Friday evening (around 11pm) and Michiel was happy to check us in and made us feel very welcome.  The apartment is in a fantastic central location and was very clean and tidy.  Would definitely recommend Michiel's apartment to friends and hope to go back there if we get the chance.

The apartment is great and looks just like in the pictures. It's location is amazing, right in the city center."
11094104;99943259;2016-09-06;78123987;Michał;Świetna lokalizacja, super wygodne łóżko, przestronny apartament. Jedyną niedogodnością mogą być strome i wąskie schody.
11094104;103408829;2016-09-22;10109001;Joey;"Michiel's place is in just a fantastic location.  There's a tram stop just outside of the building which, I believe, comes straight from Centraal (Amsterdam central station), but we prefer walking and the walk from Centraal was a mere 10-15 minute walk and is very pleasant and safe.  The bed was comfortable, and the space, as you can see in the photos, is very unique.  It overlooks some of the streets of Amsterdam with a beautiful view, and the high ceilings opened the room in a unique way that most European flats don't.  Be mindful that the unit is a few floors up a narrow staircase; but in my opinion that just adds to the authenticity of the unit.  There is no shortage of bars and bakeries in Amsterdam, so you'll find plenty of local bars within a stone's throw.  I have to recommend our favorite bakery that we found while there; it's one block to the west and on the outside appears to be a delicious cheese shop (which it is) but they also offer some of the best baked items I've ever had.  At extremely affordable prices and great value bottles of wine with free cheese tastings you really can't go wrong."
11094104;108910092;2016-10-18;15524224;Yu-Ching;We didn't meet Michiel. His friend Robert host us and he was very nice. The location was excellent and we had a great time there.
11094104;129792557;2017-02-02;4413769;Jodie;Our stay at Michiel's was great. His friend Adele hosted us and she was lovely and a great communicator. The location can't be beat - just a block from the canals, great restaurants, bars, bakeries and cheese shops. And only a 15 min walk or so from the wonderful museums. Would highly recommend.
1380875;6351530;2013-08-09;7574564;Lina;"Me and my boyfriend had a great stay at Iris', the room is the top floor of a traditional Dutch house. It was very spacious and well ventilated, the bed was huge and super comfortable and the bathroom/shower was also very big and very cozy (don't miss the oportunity for a relaxing bath at the end of the day)
We had barely used the kitchen, but it seemed well suited for those who prefer to cook rather than to eat out.
The location of the apartament was awesome, less than 5 min. walk to the tram stop that will take you to the center, 3 coffeeshops in the same range (if you're looking for any) including one very special just accross the street. Also there were 3 supermarkets in the 10-15 min. radius, making the shopping quick and easy.
One should be aware, though, of wi-fi (though definitely present, the signal wasn't strong sometimes) and of stairs - it takes a habit to get used to Dutch staircases."
1380875;15860635;2014-07-17;3714938;Sophie;Le séjour chez Iris fut très agréable. Elle une hôtesse très accueillante et nous nous sommes tout de suite senti à l'aise dans cette vaste maison très chaleureuse où rien ne manque dans un quartier à la fois très calme et central. C'est une adresse que je recommande particulièrement et qui ne peut décevoir personne.
1380875;20595638;2014-10-02;13608193;Donat;"Iris was very good host! By the time we arrived there were all kinds of the travel books about Amsterdam and a couple of the city maps which she marked with the places we were interested in and places we did not want to miss in her opinion. On the first morning we have found a pack of coffee next to our door, which was very pleasant.

The apartment itself mostly matched photos on airbnb, but we were a bit surprised to find out the bathroom (spacious, clean, well equipped, with the table full of fresh towels) had a semi-glass door to the corridor, blur glass but still...

The stairs were steep, but it was the part of the old Amsterdam charm! The room at the attic and small balcony, we used for drinking morning coffee at, had this nearly impossible to explain aura that makes you feel you're experiencing something special."
1380875;25022219;2015-01-05;8719584;Irina;We stayed with Iris on New Year's Eve. Excellent apartment near the center (15 minutes to Rembrandt Square, 15 minutes to the Van Gogh Museum). Fully equipped kitchen, a spacious, modern bathroom with all necessary accessories. But the most important thing is the original design of the room and a lovely terrace, where to sit perfectly in the summer.Iris is very tactful and considerate. Of course, I recommend these apartments!
1380875;26054379;2015-02-02;8512208;Alícia;Iris's place is very good, we highly recommend it. It is clean, bright, wide and includes private toilet with shower, and kitchen. Besides, you can easily walk to the centre or take the tram. You will enjoy it!

1380875;70813246;2016-04-21;54689946;Kristen;Iris was very sweet. We got a little lost on the way from the airport, but Iris stayed up to greet us when we finally made it to the flat. The listing is exactly as posted and is absolutely fantastic. It has a completely private entrance with it's very own patio with overlooks the surrounding courtyards. Having your own kitchen and bathroom is a great perk as well. We felt very safe and comfortable in this air bnb. The location is great as well. A short walk or tram ride to city center and is in a nice area with lots of places to walk to. You can also walk to the Henikien Experience and Rijksmuseum as well. Would recommend this stay to a friend!
1380875;71690633;2016-04-27;1599308;Stefanie;We enjoyed staying at Iris' lovely apartment a lot. It is a very cozy and conveniently located place with a beautiful rooftop terrace. The neighborhood is awesome since it is close to all the tourist attractions, but not as busy and touristy as other parts of the city. Iris is a very friendly, helpful and communicative host. I can definitely recommend staying here!
1380875;86244433;2016-07-15;7988308;Jihan;Her apartment is in a very nice neighborhood. Very close to everything, near the tram stop with direct connection to the Central station.

Everything was clean and the furniture was a mix of vintage and modern  what creates a nice atmosphere (a bit more storage would be nice if you stay here longer than a few days)
We had a nice check in and got a few hints of places and spots to visit in Amsterdam as we have been here for the first time.
We had our own key so we were totally flexible during our stay."

1380875;128630136;2017-01-26;63856914;Marina;"El airbnb de Iris tiene todo lo necesario para pasar unos días visitando Amsterdam. Mi pareja y yo pasamos 3 noches y 4 días en este pequeño apartamento y fue perfecto. 
Se trata de una habitación con terraza, un pequeña cocina y un baño. El hecho que sea un espacio privado te da mucha independencia y eso se agradece. La estancia está totalmente equipada, utensilios de cocina prácticamente nuevos ( cacerolas, platos, vasos, cubiertos...etc) lo único que no tiene es horno, pero con el micro y la cocina ( de inducción) es más que suficiente. El baño, con un plato de ducha enorme tenía varias toallas y otros útiles que te sacan de un apuro, como secador o geles, si solo llevas lo necesario en un equipaje de mano.El agua caliente salía muy deprisa y sin problemas. La habitación tiene una cama, un mueble grande y una mesita para comer, es un espacio amplio y muy agradable. Como aspecto a mejorar, la cama cruje, es cómoda, pero a la hora de moverte cruje bastante y puedes llegar a despertarte si eres una persona de sueño inquieto.
En general, recomendaría a todo el mundo este airbnb, realzando su limpieza, privacidad y localización."
1380875;130029994;2017-02-04;67038530;Mariana;Iris ha sido súper amable con nosotros, nos explicó como movernos y donde comer, donde salir a tomar algo.. Muy muy bien! La ubicacion es perfecta, a dos manzanas del metro y si quieres ir andando al centro son 20 mins de calles bonitas.  La habitación engaña, es mucho mejor de lo que aparenta en las fotos! Súper chula! Muy amable, un 10! Volveré sin duda  !

Van alle gemakken voorzien en het dakterras is bij mooi weer heerlijk.
Wij vinden de afwerking van de keuken en badkamer wat rommelig, maar het is maar wat je zelf belangrijk vindt.
Prima verblijf in een leuke buurt in Amsterdam."

The house is big, very bright and cosy. And the loft has alot of ""cachet"". It is very well located right in the center of Amsterdam, at a walking distance of everything (Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, Vondelpark and all the beautiful canals). And you can find everything you need in the area (nice cafés and restaurants). I will recommend it highly to all myfriends!"
8139460;71455980;2016-04-25;3111606;Markus;"We had a wonderful time at Marijns patio-loft. We liked the clean architectural design a lot and find it is a sight to see. Also the district the pijp, where the loft is located, is charming and very alive. We definitely can recommend to stay at Marijns loft. 
Thank you for your hospitality!"
2633912;19630288;2014-09-15;20562871;Tracey;"Beautiful apartment,just as described, very clean with lovely roof terrace and very comfortable bed. Everything you could want and more. Fantastic location. Central station was ten minutes walk away with everything else you could want less than a one minute walk away. Shops, Cafes and restaurants and a great tram and bus connection. It could not have been easier to get around Amsterdam from here. Although the apartment was just around the corner from all of these things it was very a very quiet street.
Agaath was a lovely lady, very welcoming. She showed us how everything worked in the apartment and where everything was ( remote control lighting etc) she even provided maps and details of what was happening in Amsterdam during our stay and then she let us to get on with our weekend and to drink the white wine that she had very kindly provided and chilled for us. We really could not have asked for more and will definately be back again. I would have no hesitation in recommending Agaaths' apartment to anyone looking for a break in Amsterdam."
2633912;21253971;2014-10-13;16290108;Gela;"Agaath is very good host! The apartment is cosy, beautiful and the terrace very romantic as well.
We have one bottle of wine from host, so everything was great.
I would recommend this apartment to every couple or single visitors who want to spend nice time in Amsterdam."
2633912;22318294;2014-11-03;22000905;Anna;"Det är en otroligt fin och mysig etagelägenhet, bara runt hörnet från en trevlig och lång promenadgata som gick ändå in till Centralstationen. Väldigt centralt i trevliga Jordaan vid kanalerna. Läget kan inte bli bättre: också nära till mysiga Westerpark där vi promenerade, tittade på ankor och åt trevlig brunch en av dagarna :-) Allt i lägenheten kändes splitternytt och modernt. Mycket roligare att bo i Agaaths fräscha och vackra hem än på ett hotell!! TV, diskmaskin, wi-fi, kaffemaskin, tvättmaskin... Det enda vi möjligtvis saknade var en vanlig musikspelare eller liknande, men det var inget viktigt. 

Vi hade kontinuerlig och bra kontakt med Agaath inför resan och under vårt besök. Lägenheten passade vår lilla familj perfekt och vi kände oss varmt välkomnade när vi anlände med blommor och en vinflaska. 

PS Och förstås ett stort plus för balkongerna: en liten från köket, en ""fransk"" med stort fönster från vardagsrummet, och så den fantastiska lilla takterrassen på våning tre i lägenheten. Kändes exklusivt!"
2633912;26535179;2015-02-15;14131528;Andreea;We were at Agaath's place for 2 nights in February. Such a beautiful apartment and very well located in Amsterdam! Such a good style, I think the apartment it's even better than the photos! Agaath is so kind, a great host, she welcomed us with a good bottle of wine and tips for getting around the city. We know where we will stay the next time in Amsterdam :) thank you Agaath !!
2633912;48719543;2015-09-28;41179079;Frida;The stay at Agaarths place was great! She is a lovely host and so welcoming! The apartement is cool and have a great location on a quiet street just next to a street with good shopping, walking distance to the train station and the old part of Amsterdam. Me and my sister stayed for two nights and can really recommend this apartment. We had a great weekend! Thank you Agaarth!
2633912;67838314;2016-03-31;50261991;Quian;"The apartment was amazing, clean, tidy, close to shops around, just 15 mins walk to centraal station, you can even take a bus to centraal station and it takes only 5 mins. Very convenient!!! The neighbourhood was quiet. 

The host was so nice and friendly, we really enjoyed the stay and especially the roof top, amazing sunset. 

Highly recommended!!!!"
2633912;73441927;2016-05-08;48863753;Mary;Agaath's place is beautiful! A fantastic location near wonderful small shops and great restaurants. Only about a 15 minute walk to Centraal station. Agaath was very hospitable and had a big map of Amsterdam where she pointed out where to go and what to see. The place itself is wonderful and very well done. There are about two flights of stairs to get up to the place, but that leads to fantastic views, especially if you go up the internal stairs to the roof deck. Beautiful Windows and light, although with the great location you'll want to be out and about exploring the nearby canals!
2633912;104077287;2016-09-25;53522503;Marta;"Accueil très chaleureux, l'appartement était très propre, à proximité de toutes les commodités, toutefois un peu éloigné du centre si on veut le faire à pied. C'est tout de même une rue très calme, située à côté d'une rue très active, ce qui en fait un petit havre de paix dans cette ville de dingues. Nous avons été très heureux de séjourner chez Agaath

Thank you for everything, our stay was amazing!"

5959225;40318446;2015-07-30;18651584;Luciano;Amazing Experience!  We arrived and Jan was there to help us take the luggage up and show us around.  The apartment was in a perfect location - walking distance from everything, great views of Rembrandtplein Square.  The apartment itself was clean and exactly as described.  If I visit amsterdam again, I will surely stay here!
5959225;40970274;2015-08-03;28041443;Jonathan;Wonderful city great accommodation. Host very helpful and accommodating. Location fantastic
5959225;47402954;2015-09-18;3381691;Heather;"Dan's apartment was located in a great area that made it easy to get to all the places that we wanted to see in Amsterdam.  Upon arrival, he provided the address of the apartment and gave us a video guide that made it easy to find and enter the apartment.  

The apartment building itself is old and historic as listed, however, all the pictures shown did not match the apartment that we stayed.  The flight of stairs to get to the apartment may be difficult for some guests because they are steep and narrow.  The apartment was also cold and the central heater did not keep the apartment warm.  When I brought this up to Dan, he had agreed to come to check it out the following day."
5959225;48288415;2015-09-25;16218512;Marie;L'appartement est propre, et bien situé. Il est situé au 2 ème étage (beaucoup de marches et escalier raide). C'est une succession de petites pièces, avec 3 petites chambres (les lits sont confortables) et 2 mini sdb. La chambre du devant est très bruyante, les deux autres sont calmes. Notre checkin a été laborieux, tout d'abord parce que Dan est occupé et il est difficile de le contacter, mais aussi parce que l'adresse renseignée n'est pas la bonne. Nous avons dû prendre rdv avec un ami de Dan, et même après fixé le rendez-vous, nous avons dû patienter 50 minutes après lui (sous la pluie), ce qui n'est pas très agréable.
5959225;50110488;2015-10-09;43292749;Matthew;Dan was very communicative before, although we had a little miscommunication when we arrived that left us waiting for about an hour.  Other than that though, the apartment was a nice size and the 3 bedrooms were all great.  Could have used a few extra touches like soap for the sinks or extra towels (given the dryer didn't work), but really good value for the price.  The stairs were a great work out too
5959225;51632184;2015-10-22;759433;Andrew;We had a great stay in Amsterdam with the family and Dan was super helpful especially with the luggage since the stairs are quite steep. The apartment was close to everything and made it easy to get around.
5959225;54714669;2015-11-23;35408949;Oli;Dan made us feel very welcome and was extremely helpful. We really enjoyed our stay at his place.
5959225;57124683;2015-12-22;31128729;Marie;We had a great journey at Dan's appartment. The appartment is very well located and very clean. There is only the bedroom on the street side which is noisy (especially on saturday night).  But everything was fine !
5959225;71246242;2016-04-24;5167610;Donna;"Dan met us at the door and even carried our bags up the stairs (Wow!  Thanks!)  The apartment is extremely clean, amazingly convenient and centrally located, the beds were very, very comfortable and the showers were roomy and nice.  
This ""typically Dutch"" apartment is conveniently located near lots of clubs and nightlife -- and great restaurants.  A very fun place to stay!"
5959225;105795457;2016-10-02;64545189;Heidi;Supertoffe locatie, ideale uitvalsbasis om de stad te ontdekken!
5959225;111343271;2016-10-30;53921542;Bryan;Apartment was everything we expected, great location, large enough for the six of us, clean, beds comfy. Dan was a great host providing us with valuable restaurant tips. Tram stop outside as well as a ticket office close by for booking canal cruises etc. Added bonus was the flower market being so close as well. Would highly recommend Dan's place.
5959225;115364789;2016-11-24;1358276;Sarah;There was a slight delay in getting into the apartment when we arrived because we couldn't reach Dan at the time we had arranged to get in touch, but after an hour or so he had someone come and bring us to the apartment and the place was perfect for us. It was cosy and very centrally located and had all the amenities we needed. It was also very clean which was great. The only problem was the front bedroom, facing Rembrandplein: it was way too loud to sleep in. The music from the clubs and all the noise from people on the streets resonated very loudly in just that room until very late and our third guest had to sleep in one of the other bedrooms. I would advise future guests to think of this listing as having two really nice bedrooms and a third that can be used during the day.
5959225;120874454;2016-12-12;62371247;Mario;We had a great time at this appartement! I can absolutly recommend the appartement! It was nearly perfect!
4697359;31031699;2015-05-01;791794;Leonardo;"Qilin’s place is exactly like advertised. The flat is even better than photos.
The dining table is huge, you can comfortably eat here in 5/6 people.
The couch in the living room is beautiful.
Only the airbed was not so comfortable but we could imagine this because is not a real bed, anyway was not big deal for us.

Roof top terrace has a great view over the neighborhood, was not furnished, by the way because of the weather we could’t take advantage of it.
Tram stops (and also supermarket) are just 150 meters away from the building’s door.
Vandal park is just across the street.

Even though i never met Quilin she was very kind responsive and helpful.
Had a wonderful staying.
I defenitely would recommend this place for everyone."

5808146;79707825;2016-06-13;22584977;Alex;Carsten (sorry if it's misspelled!) was an amazing host. He met us when we arrived and gave us many tips on what to do and where to go. The apartment is even bigger than it looks in pictures, was very quiet, and in the perfect location. We were able to walk everywhere we needed. It took about 10-15 minutes to get to Christiania and 20-30 to get to Nyhvan. There is a grocery store right across the street and bike rentals nearby as well. We loved our stay!
5808146;79996579;2016-06-15;10642360;Melanie;"Friendly, cheerful, and helpful host!

It's very spacious and clean with all the amenities we needed for our 2 night stay. It is located about a 20 minute walk from the city centre and around 10 minutes by bus. Equally the airport is easily reached by 1 bus. Bo was very helpful and gave us some great advise on places to go in the city. We would like to visit again and will stay in this apartment.
5808146;111345864;2016-10-30;9522971;Casey;"Bo was an awesome host! He gave us great advise on where to eat, drinks and explore. He even had a map at the ready to show all of the places. The house is SO big! Nice and warm with a modern bathroom. This place is located between the airport and city centre which was perfect for arriving and departing Copenhagen. We could walk into the centre in 20 minutes. 
Will definitely be staying here every time I visit Copenhagen."

We would recommend it to our family and friends."

Thanx to Bai!

He also helpfully let us check out later than usual as we had a late flight, which helped us out a lot. The apartment had all the amenities needed, and looks as good as the pictures, very well designed! It is located in a great central location so we walked to many of Copenhagens tourist attractions - most could be reached in 20 minutes maximum. Would definitely stay again if we visited this lovely city for a second time.

The room itself was great; comfortable and clean - we felt right at home during our stay. The kitchen area was spotless and we had no issues cooking food in the evening. The bathroom was tiny, with the shower directly above the toilet - but you shouldn't be put off at all, as it added to a more authentic Copenhagen experience.

The location was perfect, with plenty of local supermarkets/bakeries if you want to eat on the cheap during the day. (The bakery at the bottom of the road and across the street did amazing Danish pastries).

It takes about an hour to walk into Copenhagen so instead we hired bicycles for two days - something that we couldn't recommend enough. There are plenty of places nearby to hire bikes from, all in walking distance. It was extremely easy to get into the centre - just one straight road with plenty of bars and restaurants along the way.

All in all, staying at Nicolaj's place, made the trip such an enjoyable experience. I recommend hiring bicycles to make the most of this fantastic location and Copenhagen. 

Thanks Nicolaj!"

10559759;148707167;2017-05-01;18243872;Rachel;Frederikke went out of her way to look after my partner and I during our stay, we felt right at home in her cozy apartment. Being a foodie like us she shared lots of local tips on where to eat, including one of the best pizza's we have ever tasted from West Market! The apartment has a cool New York vibe with a well equipped kitchen and large, cozy living room. The apartment is located in the heart of hip Vesterbro, surrounded by trendy cafes and design stores. An amazing apartment in an unbeatable location, we definitely recommend staying with Frederikke if you have the chance!

Lejligheden var skøn og meget charmerende, og området kunne ikke være bedre, da det lå meget tæt på centrum af København og samtidig lidt for sig selv i nærheden af Christianshavns kanal med en rolig og hyggelig atmosfære. Og kommunikationen med værtsparret har været upåklagelig hele vejen igennem. Jeg kan varmt anbefale denne denne lejlighed!

Mette's brother-in-law showed us around the apartment and provided us some great tips on what to do during our stay.  Mette had left leaflets for us to browse through and get some good ideas as well on what to do.

The apartment wasn't too far from the train station and everything was within walking distance.  About 20 minutes from the city centre. We took the 3hr free walking tour which was excellent, we learnt alot about the history of Copenhagan.  

Mette was a very good host. She had left us tips on where to eat out and listed several good bars which we made use off :)   

We really enjoyed our stay.

It is a wonderful and sunny and calm apartment and Tine was away during the time, but available via phone or text message.  Her home is in a very central and cool part of Copenhagen - with many restaurants, nightlife and scenes of young Copenhagen life everywhere.  I spent 9 days and really enjoyed just walking around the neighbourhood - but could ride my bike anywhere.  GREAT bed and kitchen.  Can only say that I would visit again and happily so!

Everything was clean and arranged for us to have a great stay - Elena thinks of everything and is a really great host. On the table in the kitchen, she made a nice ""user manual"" for everything you want to now about nearby public transportation, how to use different stuff like the stove and all kinds of other details so you have everything you need. There even was a first aid kit just in case. 
Elena was very welcoming and nice to talk with. She handed us the key and we had a nice and easy arrangement for checking out. 
We were even offered breakfast - Elena had eggs and other stuff for us to make and eat in the morning for our 1 night stay. 

Apartment was spacious, clean, cosy with a nice and big bathroom, a big kitchen, living room and a great size bedroom with a very comfy bed to get a good nights sleep in. 

Not a single thing to complain about, only the opposite. 
Thank you very much for being a great host and for your fast reply when we booked the apartment a few hours before arrival.!"

We were shown around the house and made to feel at home. Knud gave us direction to all the local amenities. The house is perfectly located only 4 stops from the airport and 5 stops from city centre on the metro, which is a 4 min walk from the house. The house is beautiful, modern as shown in the pictures and 50metres from the beach. I would stay here again and I would highly recommend Knud's house.

Christina could not do enough for us to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The apartment is very close to the metro and supermarket. It is a very clean, spacious and functional apartment. My son loved having toys to play with while there also. The park and playgrounds outside the apartment were fantastic. Christina provided maps, recommendations and rain coats for us. She also checked in via the Airbnb message function during our stay to see if all was going well and to see if we needed anything. The welcome message on the door was a lovely touch also. Thank you for a fantastic stay Christina. We all had a blast in Copenhagen. What a beautiful city it is. Hopefully we'll be back to stay here again.

Very quiet but at the same time near restaurants, mini markets and cafes. Just in front the 9A bus stop which one will reach you in 10 mins to the main train station (and other points in the city as well). Floor 5, no lift, it was no problem for me.

L'appartement est vraiment très bien situé à 10' maxi du centre à pied.
Nous n'avons pas vu Mette mais elle répond très rapidement aux textos.
Il faut juste savoir que si vous louez une voiture, comme ce fût notre cas, stationner est hors de prix (compter environ 45€ par jour aux horodateurs , c'est même payant la nuit !!!). Nous avons réussi à trouver de très nombreuses places gratuites à 10' à pied (utile quand on se sert pas de la voiture tous les jours).
En tout cas, nous avons passé un superbe séjour"

Mette's sister welcomed us and even helped us with our bags.  The apartment was clean, comfy, equipped with every amenity we needed and was beautifully decorated in hip, modern Danish style.  We absolutely LOVED the location!  It's amazingly close to cool cafes, restaurants, a bike shop where we rented bikes for the week, etc..  The building has a secure enclosed open green space where children can play and residents can picnic or just enjoy the outdoors.  Our daughter enjoyed playing there.  Overall, we loved staying at Mette's apartment and wouldn't mind going back again!

The apartment is placed in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood; there is a metro station just five minutes away. It just took us 20 minutes from the airport to the apartment and five minutes from the apartment to the city center. The apartment is very well equipped and the beds are comfortable. 

Regarding the host, Peter was very attentive before and during the trip, when we wrote him to ask anything, he answered us promptly.
To sum up, we spent nice days in Copenhagen, which is an amazing city, and we were very comfortable in Peter’s apartment.

The location is great: Just a few meters away from the sea and walking distance from a beach. 5 minutes walk to Nordhavn train station and from there 5-10 minutes to the city center and all other attractions. I love the balcony that belongs to the room. With sea view and when sunny (more often than expected) you can sit in the sun in a comfortable seat until very late. Christine is super friendly and communicative. Last but not least the bed cannot be more comfortable.

The room itself was spotless, and facilities included a DVD player and a small library of DVDs. The shared bathroom was also clean.

Earplugs were offered because of the general street noise. I'm a heavy sleeper so I was content to manage without them but noise was an occasional nuisance. Still, it's not like having a disco or rock band under your bedroom, which has been an experience of mine, and it's tolerable unless you're a light sleeper."
29051;40568177;2015-08-01;30744807;Denise;I stayed for four nights at Edwin's place. It was a great experience.

I loved the experience of staying in a building that had lots of history with the big windows overlooking a  main street. The place had everything I needed....even morning coffee and the most adorable cat! Thank you again Edwin.
29051;42660007;2015-08-15;11559932;Rob;Edwin was a warm and friendly host.  He was a little stressed when I arrived because his washing machine had died and he was under the hammer, but we had a pleasant interaction.  The location was incredibly central and easy to get anywhere.  The disadvantage was the level of noise at night which went until 5am each night as revellers poured out of the bars down the road.  The bathroom was adequate though for sharing between 4 rooms it was pretty tiny.
29051;45081591;2015-08-31;8766027;Habib;"Edwin was really nice ! He has a warm smile and everything went very smoothly :) He was very flexible with my checkout as well, which was very nice of him.
The bedroom is very cute, and the location was PERFECT. 
if you want  to stay in the center i definitely recommend this room"
29051;53678191;2015-11-11;22886401;Glen;Edwin was very friendly and accommodating. The place is very chill, lots of natural light with plenty of space for a single room. It can be a little noisy at night, but there are no cars, so the conversations are quite peaceful, really.
29051;58998388;2016-01-05;39966802;Paula;The location is very good ! And Edwin is a very nice person . Helped a lot !!! Hope come back again
29051;60769609;2016-01-27;42844877;Fred;Great host, great location, cozy and definitely a bargain for the money. Edwin was helpful, welcoming and was always there if you needed him. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam. Location is superb.
29051;60906569;2016-01-29;16807432;Spencer;The room is excellent. The location is perfect. Edwin is a really nice and friendly person! I will definitely look into staying here again next time I am in Amsterdam.
29051;61151690;2016-02-01;15212907;Lenka;It was my third stay at Edwins place. Everything was just perfect. Thank you Edwin for making my stay fabulous!
29051;66043198;2016-03-19;55847027;Kevin;I had a wonderful experience at Edwin's. His place is in a perfect location (right next to the Flower Market) and it was extremely easy to get anywhere in the city. The room itself is small with a bathroom directly next to the bedroom. If you are looking for a centrally located, clean and safe place to stay during your time in Amsterdam, I would highly recommend staying here.
29051;66836397;2016-03-25;61212582;Anne;"Edwin was a great host! The room for one person (which could easily be shared by two as well) is very comfortable. Of course - as to expect in a house in one of the smaller streets in Amsterdam - it is not huge, but definitely big enough to accommodate one person and fulfill all needs. Edwin even provided towels! The bathroom, which is shared with other guests, was always very clean.
The location itself is right by the flower market and you can easily walk to a lot of the sights or just wander through the canals. If you're not into walking the tram station close by brings you to a lot of other great places. With streets such as Spui and Spuistraat close by you are not only close to museums but also great restaurants and bars. At night it can be loud and the street lantern can shine into your room if you don't use the curtains (I didn't because I like waking up to sunlight), but if that doesn't bother you and you're not a light sleeper, traveling by yourself and willing to explore the city, this is a great location for you. I had a good time and would definitely recommend Edwin's place!"
29051;79673697;2016-06-13;39497387;Zeynep;This house is all you need for Amsterdam! It is located in the center and you can go anywhere you want, from the most visited places to your special preferences. My room was also really good, I liked eveything about it. And Edwin, what an amazing person he is! Thanks for helping me, telling everything i needed to know about the city and specially I enjoyed all our funny chats! Thank you!
29051;80194997;2016-06-16;61572729;Elio;"Edwin was a super nice host, made me feel very welcome. Everything was super clean and tidy, the room was perfect, the bed was soft and the bathroom was nice too.
Edwin also gave me directions to find a couple of things I needed and was always available to talk.
The place is perfectly located in the middle of everything; it's half way of everthing so I was able to walk to every place.
And Edwin, I'll always dearly remember your umbrella and when you told me ""take it, take it"" with a smile. It was a life saver and helped me in more ways than I expected"
29051;87790705;2016-07-21;56334601;Michael;Edwin was a caring and great host! Location is fantastic and the room fit my needs perfectly.  If I come back to Amsterdam,  I will look to stay at Edwin's.
29051;102144295;2016-09-17;7946231;Cindy;Edwin was very welcoming and ensured I had everything I needed.
29051;105333133;2016-10-01;76087340;Lisa;Had a glorious time- beautiful room with ab extremely comfortable bed. Right in the hub of things with every possible need at your fingertips
14542822;135444162;2017-03-05;116726136;Serena;Alloggio pulito , non lontano dal centro , mi sarei aspettata di peggio invece è andata molto bene .
13467895;99291509;2016-09-04;86235578;Stian;We arrived Friday afternoon, and was welcomed on arrival! the fridge was full for us to use. The apartment it self was stunning, if anything it is better than the picture. The host gave us plenty of recomondations of where to go and eat etc. I Highly recomend this apartment and this host. I hope we will be back :)
13467895;113576845;2016-11-13;55482692;Rachael;"Reineke gave us a lovely warm welcome to her beautiful apartment. It's an amazing place, lots of light and space, it feels luxurious but very cosy at the same time. There is everything that you need for a relaxing stay, and some really nice extra touches from Reineke including a birthday card and bottle of wine for my mum (we were celebrating her birthday) and a well stocked fridge. The beds were very comfortable, there's a wonderful bath in the main bedroom and huge shower - plenty of hot water, towels etc.  The temperature in the apartment was just right - not too hot or stuffy but not at all cold either.  There's a large TV, the kitchen is well equipped and the whole place was spotlessly clean.  There's a wonderfully eclectic mix of artwork around the place but no clutter at all - something to aspire to in my own home!  The location is fantastic - about 10 mins walk to Central Station where you can pick up a tram.  Plenty of good places to eat within easy walking distance:  Oggi for excellent Italian food or Cafe Bird for really good Thai food.  Also an Albert Hein grocery shop next to De Waag, and a great food/flower market there too.  We had a great stay and I would definitely recommend this place.
Thank you Reineke!"
13467895;124559331;2017-01-02;11223758;Laura;We stayed at Reineke's amazing apartment for New Years. Everything was as shown in the pictures. We all agreed this is the best place we've stayed. The place gave you a home feeling with the luxury extras. The main bedroom is huge, the bath & shower were both clean and amazing! Both the beds were very comfortable and gave us the needed good nights sleep. The apartment is very cosy and we loved the design and all the small perfect details. We had breakfast bits and a bottle of bubbly on our arrival. The location was perfect. Everything is on your door step but far enough for a quiet place to retreat to after a busy day. We would love to come back again!
1229823;10390358;2014-02-17;10808574;Kim;Our weekend in Ruben's home in Amsterdam was wonderful!  The city is a lively gem, and we were so happy with the availability of public transportation so close to the home, and the ability to see so much in a weekend's time.  The only small disappointment was that the property is advertised as including free parking, but we ended up paying to park (it cost us 48 Euro for Friday night to Sunday).  Ruben was fantastically accommodating and really gave us a warm welcome. His home was a very comfortable place to come back to at the end of a long day of sightseeing.  A great experience overall!  Thanks again Ruben!
1229823;73081089;2016-05-06;25038674;Anne-Marie;The house of Ruben and Gaby is very nice, spacious and very well located close to trams, shops and restaurants. A quiet neigbourhood with nice footballfield for the children close by, You can reach Amsterdam Central Station in only a very short tram ride and the house is also very close to the P&R Zeeburg to park your car. Communication with Gaby and Ruben is very quick and friendly. Everything about the house, the equipment and your stay is explained very well. Thank you Ruben and Gaby for the nice stay in your beautiful house.
1229823;133870525;2017-02-25;115958607;Franckkatia;Logement de Ruben et gaby super chaleureux . Ce sont des gens très gentilles et à l'écoute de leur voyageurs . Merci à eux ... vivement conseillé pour visité Amsterdam car près des transports en commun sans etre trop loin du centre ville .. bon sejour' au futur voyageurs.
6159327;67249655;2016-03-27;62421564;Narcis;Localización fabulosa especialmente para la visita a los museos, con buena comunicación hacia el centro con tranvia y buen acceso al aeropuerto con el autobús 197. La casa está bien, tiene tres niveles. Los nivels se comunican con una escalera muy inclinada y los escalones algo pequeños. Los baños están bien, las habitaciones individuales son algo infantiles. En general hemos estado muy bien. El arrendatario es muy cordial y es fácil ponerse en contacto con el y amablemente se prestan a ayudarte.
6159327;75863653;2016-05-23;3713363;Massimo;"Jorrit e sua moglie sono stati davvero ospiti gentilissimi!
La casa era assolutamente come mostrata nell'annuncio: bellissima e accogliente. Inoltre hanno lasciato a disposizione tutto quello che occorre ad una famiglia numerosa come la nostra!
Il quartiere è il meglio che si possa sperare: ad un canale dal centro e  a cinque minuti a piedi dai musei; con tutto quello che occorre a disposizione: negozi, ristoranti, bici da noleggiare ecc.. 
Insomma l'ideale per chi vuole fare una vacanza in questa splendida città!
Grazie Jorrit e Will!"
14331456;92275912;2016-08-08;1729266;Nicole;My friend and I were visiting Amsterdam for a day and we were lucky to have found Manon's apartment, just one week from our visit. I had experienced many times where AirBnB hosts in Amsterdam either cancelled our stay nor did not answer my messages at all, and it was so reassuring to be communicating with someone that was reliable and so very helpful. I did not get to meet Manon unfortunately because I arrived so late but my friend did and se noted that she was very helpful in checking her in and also letting her know some things to do in the city. Our stay with Manon was wonderful and I wish we could have extended our stay longer because we loved the apartment so much. It's very well decorated and it made us feel so much at home that we almost wanted to stay in and admire Amsterdam from the apartment. The street is quiet but walkable to bars and late night eats and right outside is a stop for the tram that we easily took to and from the airport, the Anne Frank House, and Vondelpark! We would definitely considering staying here again.
1942082;11579235;2014-04-08;2280361;Dean;Barbara's apartment was perfect for our stay. Away from the tourist traps and located in a cool area. With great bars and restaurants you can't go wrong here. Also it's an easy trip on the tram or by foot or bike to Amsterdam central. Barbara's apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay, we highly recommend it.
1942082;13409639;2014-05-27;13186793;Christine;Barbara is a thoughtful host, the place was very nice, clean and she let you some recommendation on place to go around the flat. Very bright and well-placed : we had a very good time, thanks! :)
1942082;13808896;2014-06-04;10154545;Theodore;The reservation was canceled 57 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1942082;16466809;2014-07-28;16000305;Hannah;Barbara was a great host, with a beautiful flat. We instantly felt welcome with a personal message on the chalkboard, clear instructions of how to use everything in the flat and a package of leaflets with the local events for the summer, all left on the table. The apartment is stunning, light, spacious and comfortable (feeling bigger than the photos look). It is stylishly decorated and clean, with lovely balconies at both the front and back. The location is perfect to feel like you live in Amsterdam. Everything you would need is a short walk away, including 2 great gluten free eateries, Vondelpark and the local supermarket, ah. The tram is only a street away for easy access into the city. It was a perfect romantic getaway and we would definitely recommend staying here. Big thanks to Barbara for such a lovely stay.
1942082;21288104;2014-10-14;20487077;Rob;"We stayed in the flat for 3 nights and loved it, the area was perfect, great distance into the centre to either walk or catch the tram. The flat itself was better than the pictures, v v clean and well presented, Barbara made us feel very welcome and accommodated us well with our arrival and departure times. She also gave us good recommendations about places to go in the local area. 

We really enjoyed our stay in Dam and the flat was the cherry on top! We definitely recommend staying."
6839285;51532078;2015-10-21;22315486;Margaret;Silvia was a great host and was there to greet us on our arrival. Her apartment was really nicely designed and comfortable, with everything we needed on the same street. We would love to stay again next time we're in Amsterdam and we will recommend to friends.
6839285;57009443;2015-12-21;34882022;Serena Juyeon;제가 머물렀던 숙소중에 최고였어요. 집이 너무 예뻐서 하루종일 집에만 있고 싶은 느낌, 집에서 계속 사찍게되요 ㅋㅋ 수압이나 라디에이터 모두 최고(유럽은 이게 되게 중요해요 한국에선 기본이지만ㅠㅠ)그릇들부터 인테리어 소품들 하나하나 실비아의 손길이 닿은게 느껴졌고, 청소업체를 따로 쓰시는것 같았어요. 깨끗함의 정도가 전문가의 손길. 파리 테러 이후 이웃들의 민원이 있어서 안타깝게도 저희가 마지막 게스트라고 하네요. 최고의 숙소.
6839285;110411408;2016-10-26;29840005;Quentin;A beautiful apartment, in a lovely town. Perfect place to discover Amsterdam
8418504;84621308;2016-07-08;61605288;John;Laura greeted us when we arrived and was very friendly. Her apartment was perfect for us with one child sleeping very comfortably on the couch with an extra mattress.
8418504;138212991;2017-03-19;13449641;Kate;Laura was a great host - very communicative and helpful. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable and located within walking distance from the museums. Also lots of cafes and restaurants nearby :)
12426352;77228958;2016-05-30;52518183;Samar;Mirjam was very lovely, as she kept in touch before the trip. Unfortunately there was miscommunication that was solved soon after. We had a great time staying at their place and would recommend it to others.
12426352;102430803;2016-09-18;64951073;Naomy;"Senad and Mirjam were amazing. Since the moment we arrived they were in contact with us, waited at the apartment and gave us first hand advise on where to go and which are the nicest spots around the area. 

The flat was great, spacious, quite and calm. Which I didn't expect as I knew it was located where the market is. Area wise- you will be situated between all good things - touristic and local - everything is a walking distance, but we enjoyed the bikes. Beautiful canals and so many restaurants around! We liked it. 

Senad and Mirjam drove us to the airport which was so nice as taxis are expensive. I actually left my ID in the flat and Senad and Mirjam drove back from city center to the airport again just to give it to me(!) , that was amazing!

Thank you for a great time!"
12426352;104303682;2016-09-26;26074448;Julien;I went back in Senad and Miriam's house because I feel like home there. Everything is easy, nice, and confortable ! Hope to come back soon
12426352;107059413;2016-10-09;22841399;Christina;Senad thank you so much, you guys made my whole family feel so welcomed and at home. We loved the apartment as it was not only homey, but the style and design was fun and beautiful. Thank you for showing my hubby how the trans worked, and how great you guys were with my boys.  They said we should come back and we plan to again, I loved how your apartment was close to everything, how easy it was to get from place to place. thank you guys so much for making our stay wonderful, we definitely will be back to stay again.
2462491;55813045;2015-12-06;48348091;Mohammed;Great place to stay, not too far from the city center!
2462491;72771688;2016-05-04;63755860;Yoann;"Very nice appartment.
It was confortable and in a great place for those who want to discover Amterdam and its suburbs.
Thank you Laura even if we didn't meet you."
13072623;105499405;2016-10-02;9988692;Natalia;The room is light and modern, it's well equipped and has a great location (very interesting neighbourhood and close to the station and city center). We enjoyed our stay very there much!
13034728;85751823;2016-07-13;55465867;Gitte;Very Nice flat. Not too far from Amsterday, Which we could reach in max 30 minutes when leaving the flat. The flat was clean and everything was in perfect order. We had a Very Pleasant stay in the flat. Good kicthen, good livingroom, bedroom and bathroom. Very nice view from the flat overlooking water. Also good lokal shops close by.
15978064;136773764;2017-03-12;60181404;Tayfun;It is clean and lovely place. Marina also put some nice breakfast things with holland cheese and juice.. She is helpfull, and house is perfect
8657220;73239149;2016-05-07;57925339;Travis;Juul and his family were wonderful hosts, they gave us a brief tour of their lovely houseboat and also gave us plenty of recommendations on things to do in their area of town.  The houseboat was well appointed with all the necessities, clean, and was available as expected.   Thanks for a lovely time, Juul!
8657220;95630705;2016-08-20;84062084;Gilad;"Juul's friend welcomed us and was very nice, helpful and informative.
The boat is very spacious, convenient and beautifully designed, a tasteful mix between the original boat and the modern renovation.
We had a wonderful time, staying at the house boat certainly upgraded our stay in Amsterdam. A great location in a quiet neighborhood but not far from the center.
Highly recommended!"
14568123;101513438;2016-09-13;31277329;Nishith;Malaguetta is a great host. He is very helpful, proactive and friendly. The listing is at an amazing location and this is actually my second stay here. I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting Amsterdam and who wants to be in the heart of all the action that the city has to offer.
14568123;107768740;2016-10-12;5392128;Kevin;Good room in the middle of the redlight district.
14568123;109077307;2016-10-19;16482183;Sheridan And Fraser;This accommodation was right in the centre of Amsterdam city and really convenient to the central railway station and cafes and shops. Very easy to access. The room was tidy, private and secure. Very well priced. Probably best for one person travelling alone so suited me fine.
14568123;116645422;2016-12-02;31635589;Fernando;Awesome place in the city center, nice host and experience.
14568123;130656704;2017-02-07;112116748;Vladimir;Very good location in center of Amsterdam, definitely worth the price :) Recommend!
14568123;130920537;2017-02-09;9242124;Yung Shiang;Close to the metro station and could get to the train station easily. If you just want a convenient place to stay this might be OK.
1663469;8980320;2013-11-30;293919;Niamh;We've been to Amsterdam many times and stayed in various accomadations but the one we'll recommend to our friends is Barbara's. It's a studio apartment which normally I'm no too fond of, especially when I'm away with my boyfriend, but the way it's laid out means that you have plenty of privacy. We stayed here for more than a month (of course we find the perfect place when we finally move here!) and it wasnt an issue. There's a private little balcony for smokers, a lovely kitchen, high speed wifi, and a tv with loads of English speaking channels. It's tucked away on a lovely quiet street with the tram about a min walk away which will take you into the city in about 5 mins. There are a few supermarkets, restaurants, takeaways, coffeeshops, cafes and all the vitals within a minutes walk. Barbara was very welcoming and helpful, she knows about all the cool concerts and events and nothing was too big an ask. Little details like fresh towels, info folder, strong wifi, cool shower and a Wii make this apartment stand out (we've stayed in a lot of Amsterdam apartments!). If you're looking for your own place in Amsterdam that's easy and quick to get to, where you can come and go as you please, have all the privacy you need and is super clean, you won't regret staying at Barbara's.
1663469;58291797;2016-01-02;42516386;Monika;Staying at Barbaras Place has been Great .Barbara war ein super Host.Von Anfang an sehr hilfsbereit und zuverlässig.

Bon Bini bei Barbara .
7027691;42879909;2015-08-16;2880285;Toni;Ludwig's house is very nice, very cozy and very clean. It is as shown in the pictures. It is situated in a quiet neighborhood and very nice too, near the city center, the museums and the Amsterdamse Bos. Ludwig and Anne Sophie helped us a lot with the information they have provided. We have been very comfortable and really recommend her home to spend a few days in Amsterdam.
7027691;58040229;2015-12-31;10941557;Mohammad;Ludwigs Apartement is awesome. He was very informative and nice. We totaly recommend his place. Thank you and all the best
7027691;86811078;2016-07-17;12526331;Liz;Ludwig is a great host and made everything very easy for us. We had wanted an earlier check in and he did everything possible to accommodate us in the friendliest and most helpful manner. Really lovely family. We loved out stay. Thank you so much!
7027691;114699707;2016-11-20;21369034;Jason;The place was perfectly as described and in a good location about 4km from the Central Station so easy by tram (line 5) or by bike. We arrived late at night but access was straightforward and the property was clean and warm. It had a lovely feel to it aswell which made for a pleasant stay. A few good takeaway restaurants nearby also helped after a long day sightseeing.
13289321;90394470;2016-08-01;566487;Isabel;Ana's apartment was perfect for our Amsterdam trip. It is bright, spacious, clean and cozy. The neigborhood is very nice with cool places for drinks and dinner nearby. Thanks Ana and maybe we will see us soon.
13289321;97624322;2016-08-28;69975839;Fred;This is a really lovely apartment in a lively and interesting area of Amsterdam, quite distinct from the centre.  The check-in process was smooth, Ana was very polite and accommodating and communication beforehand was excellent.  I recommend this as a place to stay!
14144738;102761044;2016-09-19;30918206;Marcin;"Host was great and very kind. She gave me map with important places and help me with anything. 
I do recommend that host."
14144738;114545465;2016-11-19;4652633;Giulia;The apartment is good. Easy to reach from the airport and well connected. I stayed 12 days, I rented a bike near the corner for a good price. The atmosphere is clean and cozy. Carmen is kind and very happy to help in giving advice and directions!
6085243;45181202;2015-08-31;968827;Maureen;Maika was a warm and friendly hostess - she greeted us at the apartment and showed us around, giving us tips for our stay and leaving us a great bottle of chianti and some snacks!  Her apartment is beautifully decorated - just like in a magazine - and she has the most amazing big bathtub (perfect for two :-) The location is further out from the center canals I prefer, but the price is so much less! Unfortunately, we were there on the last Saturday of August and some of her neighbors had a huge, loud, outside party just behind her house.  There was no way for her to know in advance and she was very quick to answer our concern by email and text, calling her friends to check and call the police if they didn't quiet down. Her response was professional and sympathetic - she clearly was as surprised as we were! She was a great host!
6085243;86921234;2016-07-18;74854848;Alice;Maika was a great host. She left a very helpful local information booklet which included back up contact numbers in case there was any issue. The area is great and it was an enjoyable walk into the centre. The apartment was fantastic. The interior was beautifully decorated with lots of athmospheric lighting and interesting objects. The garden terrace was a lovely place for a morning tea. Overall it was a great place to stay.
10675019;81098047;2016-06-21;36816525;Matthew;Joris and his wife made us feel very welcomed! The apartment was along the Albert Cuyp market and it was nice to go outside of the door and have everything there. They gave us a tour of the place and it looked just like it did in the pictures. They even had a map of Amsterdam for us and pointed out the easiest routes to the different landmarks and museums! This was overall one of my favorite stays and I would do it all over again!
10675019;101097567;2016-09-11;3296162;Lior;"Great apartment, large and central.
The host was very communicative and welcoming."
17273520;136088206;2017-03-08;61822593;Cleoda;This place was amazing and i would look to stay here again when I return to Amsterdam. The place is better than the photos, a lot of space and modern updates.  I was very impressed and happy.
4981876;37508907;2015-07-07;27765502;Jakub;"We have had the most amazing time in Eltjo's place. It's a clean, spacious flat for 2-3 people with big comfortable beds. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood 5 minutes from a park and about 15 mins on bike from a city centre. It's also a nice walking distance from Museum district. There is also a tram station just around the corner with direct connection to the Central station.

Eltjo was extremely helpful, shared some really useful tips about Amsterdam with us and recommended us cheap but reliable bike rental company and several restaurant close by - we tried 3 of them and can only recommend following his list. 

I would definitely recommend this to a couple or group of 3 people who want to quiet base for exploring wonders of Amsterdam."
4981876;39321272;2015-07-22;36855550;Fiona;Eltjo was a lovely and attentive host who made our stay in Amsterdam comfortable and pleasant. He responded to any of my queries very quickly which made organising our stay so much easier. The apartment is in a great area, close to the centre of the city and close walking distance to nice restaurants, cafes, shops and museums. It also has easy access to trams just outside the apartment. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay, the apartment was comfortable and clean and there's a lovely garden outside. Just be aware though that there is no kitchen sink but that wasn't really a problem as there is a bathroom sink and washing up supplies (bucket etc). I would recommend anyone to stay in Eltjos apartment.
4981876;66467656;2016-03-22;30108284;Esperanza;I rented Eltjo apartment for my mum, aunt & grandmother, they had a great time there! Even he took them to the airport when they left, so thank you so much, you were an excellent host! My grandmother told me to specially thank you for that!
4981876;114545159;2016-11-19;47342970;Hazem;"It was nice stay, Mr. Elyjo is very kind person and very welcome his apartment is private, clean and quiet, 20 minutes from the center station with the trum line 2 and night bus number 758 
I recommend this apartment for any one going to Amsterdam"
14550976;104003864;2016-09-25;523663;Chris;"We were only in Amsterdam for a few days but Frederick's apartment gave us the perfect home base to explore Amsterdam. Check in and out was super easy, and communication was no problem. 
Plus, of course, the apartment is beautiful, well equipped and spacious.
We hope to visit again!"
14550976;108793281;2016-10-17;90411691;Adeline;"L'appartement, en tous points fidèle à la description, est très fonctionnel pour un couple avec un bébé (14 mois).
Il est idéalement placé, à deux pas du tramway et du magnifique parc Vondelpark. Il est très facile de rejoindre le centre ville à pied.
Frederik est très réactif par mail. Malgré son absence, il a été très facile de récupérer les clés auprès de sa voisine Lotte.
Un très bon séjour dans un lieu propre et charmant."
14550976;111486162;2016-10-31;94938244;Leonardo;"Great Apartment! Excelent Host, Frederik & Sofi , i appreciated the flexibility and the way to treat the  host. Great Location, very easy to move , anywhere.
Thank you very much! I would choose again if I return to amsterdam"
1959340;9560854;2014-01-02;9825236;Marion;Ingeborg (and his husband)was just perfect! She gaves us a lot of advices to visit the city, the boat house was very beautiful and clean, just as on photos...with a bike is very near from the center...a good place to go!!!
1959340;12763411;2014-05-10;6077841;Thibault;super plan chez Ingeborg et Renze ! Beaucoup de place dans le bateau, cuisine et salle de bain très bien équipées. Quartier calme, à 10 minutes en vélo du centre ville ! Très proche des transports en commun aussi, indispensables les jours de pluie. Les hôtes très souples vis-à-vis de notre réservation de dernière minute, très accommodants pour nous accueillir en fonction de nos horaires. good experience !
1959340;23189342;2014-11-24;23840056;Shyamalan;Ingeborg's boat was a wonderful place to stay for our weekend in Amsterdam. It's spacious, well-furnished, and in a quiet spot on the river, but there are plenty of amenities within walking distance. Getting to the city is super easy - 10-15 minutes by bus or tram. Waking up and stepping out to see the sun rise over the river, was a wonderful way to start each day. Ingeborg was really helpful. She gave us great advice on where to go and how to get around. Ahead of our trip she even researched kid-friendly activities since we were traveling with our 4-year old son. I definitely recommend this place and am planning to go back.
1959340;26885646;2015-02-21;8026607;Szonja;Ingeborg ist eine sehr liebe Gastgeberin, das Hausboot ist geräumig, gemütlich und sehr sauber, die Lage ist perfekt: ruhig und zentral.
1959340;46166012;2015-09-08;40488419;Teresa;"Abans d'iniciar el viatge, Ingeborg ens va enviar informació pràctica per arribar a l'allotjament i sobre diferents aspectes logístics relacionats amb Amsterdam o recomanacions de llocs per visitar que ens va ser molt útil.  Una gran amfitriona.
Durant l'estada ens hem sentit molt a gust. L'apartament és tal com consta a les fotos i està en una zona molt tranquila, però ben conectada. La rehabilitació del vaixell està feta amb molt de gust. Tot i tractar-se d'una embarcació, l'apartament és espaiós, acollidor i net.  En tot moment ens hem sentit molt segurs. L'embarcació ha estat molt estable i gairebé no hem notat que no estàvem en terra ferma. Ha estat una experiència molt emocionant tant pels nens com pels adults.
La reproducció de la imatge de la dama de la perla que hi ha a la paret de la sala d'estar va deixar els nens bocabadats! 
Tot un encert: reproduïda de manera senzilla, però molt original i efectiva!!
 
Llàstima que els dos vespres ha plogut, perquè ens hem quedat amb les ganes d'encendre l'estufa de llenya! Però, d'altra banda, així tenim una excusa per tornar una altra vegada!!!"
1959340;48766498;2015-09-28;23242992;Pierre;Magnifique moment dans l incroyable péniche d Ingeborg. Elle a accepté que nous arrivions très tard et nous a livré de précieux indices. Notre dimanche à NDSM fut très agréable. Merci encore.
1959340;126098698;2017-01-09;3963889;Russell;Ingeborg is a fantastic host with great suggestions and knowledge of the area. The boat is a perfect place to call home while visiting the city, it is well located and really offers a nice setting. I hope to stay here again next time I am in Amsterdam!
1959340;137267431;2017-03-14;5824269;Grissarin;Ingeborg's place is exactly like in the pictures. Her place is clean and very nice. Ingeborg also is very helpful and informative host. She gave us a lot of suggestions of to places that are not too touristy. The fact that she is living in another side of the boat makes it very easy to check-in/out and contact her. I surely will recommend her houseboat to a friend.
9162524;60065670;2016-01-18;53744782;Giulia;Our stay was great and we really enjoyed this apartment. It is located in a well served neighborhood with supermarkets and nice cafes, it is also easily connected to the center by public transport or simply by walking. It is comfortable and cozy and you can find everything you need. If you love art you will certainly appreciate the details and the style of this apartment! Unfortunately we didn't meet Dim but we can certainly confirm that he is a great host, clear, kind and very helpful, he gave us many suggestions about the city.  We recommend it to everyone!
9162524;73419005;2016-05-08;56705745;Maria Eugenia;La casa de Dim es exactamente igual a lo que muestran las fotos, un lugar muy lindo acogedor, se llega muy fácil desde la estación central y se puede caminar desde allí hacia el centro de Amsterdam. Dim fue muy atento en nuestra llegada y nos ayudo en los problemas que se nos presentaron.
870150;3954032;2013-03-30;1854144;Fabian;Marcella is a great host and will give you great advice about what to do in Amsterdam. The flat is quite cool and the room has a proper bed (I find this important). Definitely recommend staying here!
870150;11021745;2014-03-17;12494384;Maike;Deze kamer was prima. Niet erg ver van het centrum en openbaar vervoer op loop afstand.
870150;12861397;2014-05-12;13898662;Deb;Marcella is lovely. I really enjoyed meeting her, and she made me feel very welcome and safe in her wee room. The apartment has easy access to public transport, so even though it is a wee bit out of the centre, it only takes a little while before you are in the hub of the city. A pleasant stay, and a good rest. The strict rules actually made my time easier there... No pressure of having to be social. I had the space I needed to really rest up.
870150;13747882;2014-06-03;11748576;Clare;A clean, private room with a friendly and respectful host in a quiet area of Amsterdam walking or biking distance to the centre. I highly recommend this accommodation.
870150;19161320;2014-09-07;985553;Aaron;Great location in quiet, accessible neighborhood. Tram is right outside the house! I was mostly out and about all day so the room had all the essentials I needed, and hot shower in the washroom. Marcella's rules were easy to follow though I did find it easier to buy a giant bottle of mineral water from the convenience shop out front. There were plenty of restaurants within walking distance, and tram 1 that goes to central is a short walk away. Overall great experience with the city and with my stay!
9441062;58401949;2016-01-02;50841273;Rhett;Had an excellent stay.  The apartment was in a perfect location.  It was very clean and spacious.  Host was great.  Would stay again.
9441062;123704724;2016-12-30;18186917;Marie;Place was extremely well located in the heart of Amsterdam and a step away from public transportation. The living room is really nice due to the light and comfy furniture. The room doesn't face the street which makes it very silent. The check in and out were convenient and clearly explained. I would clearly recommend this place!
9441062;138751147;2017-03-21;118872012;Dor;"Very nice apartment with great locations and quickly check-in.
Except for a few lamps that did not work (especially in the bathroom)"
4696241;34809609;2015-06-12;9144146;Faris;"Sandra's place was fantastic. The space & the style give you a feeling that you’re right at home, plus the view of the river is a sight to wake up to. The area is a bit rural, with plenty of shops just around the corner.  Sandra was a fantastic host, where she helped us even with the struggle of last minute trip plan changes.

I totally recommend this place for a family or a group of friends who are looking to relax between exploring what Amsterdam has to offer. 

Thanks!"
4696241;43147391;2015-08-17;30122012;Verena;"Tolles Hausboot!

Very spacious with huge windows and a great view. My 7 yr old enjoyed feeding the ducks and it was easy to get to the city centre by tram or metro. Nice comfy beds. 
Sandra was friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. I would highly recommend everything about this accommodation."
4696241;45533073;2015-09-03;4152393;David;Very warm welcome and accommodating with change of group numbers. Pictures and description are very accurate, truly a beautiful place to stay when visiting Amsterdam.

The house was very clean and provided with clean sheets and towels. Our stay at her house boat was a wonderful and pleasant experience"
4696241;55596295;2015-12-02;44237546;Daniel;Sandra was incredibly friendly and welcoming, providing us with useful maps and tips on places to go and see. The houseboat itself was fantastic. It's modern and clean with plenty of space. It's in a nice location too, complete with a great view from the terrace. Would recommend very highly!
4696241;56165628;2015-12-09;2208398;Liz;This houseboat is spacious, beautiful and very clean. We loved every minute there, and highly recommend it to others. Sandra made check-in and check-out exceptionally easy, and communication was quick and clear.
4696241;57957037;2015-12-30;17693022;Myriam;Good experience to live in a houseboat on the Amstel in an authentic residential area, many thanks to Sandra for her welcome and great indications (visit recommendations, trip organization, etc.)
4696241;61605942;2016-02-06;54252605;Brent;Great location and wonderful hosts! If coming to Amsterdam, I can't think of a better place to stay than a houseboat on the river. The boat is spacious, comfortable, and well furnished. Highly recommend.
4696241;63412011;2016-02-22;852261;Uschi;If you happen to get the chance, stay in this fantastic houseboat and meet a truely great host. Sandra was extremely friendly and reliable, you'll feel very welcome anytime throughout your stay. As we needed some medical help one moment, she immediately did everything she could to help us. My family and me were both excited about this fantastic experience and a great trip.
4696241;64147032;2016-02-29;55310075;Dhruvil;"Staying in a houseboat probably sounds like a crazy idea at first but if this listing is available - go for it ! 

Sandra is an extremely friendly host and greeted us warmly to her place, also kept a bottle of wine to welcome us. 
The boat looks exactly as it is in the pictures, if not any better. 
Extremely clean and tidy even though the place was occupied till few hours before we arrived (That too early check-in). 

The beds are comfortable and bathroom is clean and spacious. The kitchen had all the things needed to make a meal and there is also coffee and tea. And a dishwasher ( because who likes doing dishes on a holiday ) 

The Pjip is a good area, safe and peaceful. The nearest tram station is about 12-15 mins by walk. There are some pubs and restaurants with a 10 min vicinity as well. 

We absolutely recommend this listing and the lovely sunrise that you will get to witness each morning here."
4696241;65558427;2016-03-15;43109686;Ludwig;"Was staying on the house boat with my rowing eight during ""Heineken Roeivierkamp"".

One of the two beds has a good size for two, the other one is a bit smaller but still OK. Kitchen has an easy-to-use coffee machine for pads. Good Wifi. Washing machine, tumbler and flat iron are provided.
Overall a great accommodation, we would love to come back."
327089;4016719;2013-04-02;5572984;Naveen;"Place: A nice cozy place with a mix of old and new dutch architecture and interiors. For my friend Deepak it was a nice walk down the memory lane with good thoughts of his stay at grandma's place! Something we all look forward to :)


Host: Helga was a extremely warm and nice person. She made sure we had everything we needed. My friend Deepak and I throughly enjoyed the fabulous Dutch breakfast she served us. Thumbs up for that."

1636010;21666123;2014-10-21;20009905;Fraser;Great apartment very clean in a nice location. We were in Amsterdam for the marathon and the apartment was very convenient for Olympic stadium the start and finish of the race.

With the bus we needed only 5 minutes to central station, where the heart of Amsterdam was. To walking there is only 10-15 minutes.
It was our first time to make a deal here on Airbnb and it was a really good idea, to booking this luxury apartement.

We have the feeling, we comes to friends. Thank you for this special time we have.
We hope to see you sometimes.

1527443;71334544;2016-04-24;15976592;Catriona;"After some straightforward email correspondence with Marjolein to organise and book , we were greeted outside the apartment by Arne who welcomed us (an hour earlier than the official check-in) and showed us around their beautiful apartment which looks exactly like the pictures. He was very easy going, accommodating and trusting -  telling us we could even drink his wine if we wanted and replace it later!?! We did not need to take him up on this offer, but it would  have been a great fall-back if we had decided to stay in Friday night!

The Jordaan area is very cool with some lovely bars and restaurants and a short walk to Dam square through the antique district. There is a corner shop not far away from the main circle where we bought fruit and water. Taxis were easy to hail near the main plaza also.

We rented bikes near the Jordaan area and cycled all around the city for 3 hours for €9 each - it was a great experience, if not a learning curve?! 

We love Amsterdam and the Amster dames & heren!
Thank-you,
Catríona"

Although we did not have a chance to meet her during our stay (she arranged to have a friend meet us at her apartment with the key) her communication and helpful tips were excellent in making this a wonderful stay. The location was perfect - accessible to public transport and in a very pretty, safe neighborhood- and Juliette's directions were perfect!  the apartment itself was pleasant, clean and very spacious with a lovely canal view. I cannot recommend this host or apartment highly enough and I hope to stay at Juliette's place on my next visit!

Not only is the room very nice and tidy, but also the location is very convenient. The next tramstop is about 3min by foot and the tram can take you to the city center in about 5-10mins. Alternatively, you can also walk to the center. 
Leon was a very helpful host. Before our arrival, he looked up train connections from the airport to his apartment.

I can only recommend to stay with Leon in Amsterdam.

P.S.: The room is actually on the top floor, so you have to climb a few stairs, but as Leon put it, it's good exercise;)"

Leon wasn't there but organized for us to be let in by his sister, so everything worked out perfect, he was very uncomplicated. 
I can really recommend this place.
Thanks!"
4059685;26447664;2015-02-13;25001093;Monika;A place to recommend without a doubt. Perfectly located in a peaceful neighbourhood, close to many amenities and well connected with the strict city centre. Very cozy, with the good vibes. The arrival and the whole stay proceeded smoothly. Description and photos correspond with the actual state. It turned out to be an independent apartment, not only a private room, what makes a stay even more pleasurable. The host kept being availabe in case of any inquiries.

Unless you have a strong, Dutch gentleman to help carry suitcases, do not overpack! There are 4 stories of spiral staircase... Be warned. The apartment itself was so comfortable - really nice bathroom and the lighting was lovely. 15-20 walk to the city centre and right next to the park (which was perfect for a picnic). Super peaceful neighbourhood with everything you need - bakeries, coffee shop, pharmacy, etc. Leon was very helpful with everything we asked about too.

Only thing to mention is that there is no TV at the moment - it's a monitor that Leon usually connects with his laptop. This wasn't an issue for us because there was so much to do, but just a tip for any couch potatoes! 
All in all, we had the best time - 10/10! :)"
4059685;67432783;2016-03-29;2355059;Markus;"Very nice place to stay in Amsterdam. This is actually like a private apartment, with your own bathroom and a small kitchen. It is not big but everything is there. We picked up the keys from a box with a code which made it very flexible for us.
Great neighborhood in a very central location. Very close to city center. Shops, cafés and restaurants nearby.
Leon has prepared everything for us, including city information. He was available for all questions and gave us detailled information on how to reach the apartment."
4059685;92980376;2016-08-10;68716443;Fanny;Appartement sympa dans quartier agréable (parc tout près)! Nous reviendrons avec plaisir. Leon est un très bon hôte, avec qui la communication est facile
4059685;114985819;2016-11-21;61922057;Florian;10/10 would highly recommend, nice location, cozy little room, nice view, everything as it should be
7768126;61768537;2016-02-08;26571916;Thomas;Loved our stay, definitely recommend this apartment. Perfect distance from Amsterdam centraal with only one tram to catch. Lovely area and beautiful apartment.
1339705;12663094;2014-05-07;11702121;Sergey;"Great appartments for 4 people!
Modern, clean, exquisite decorated with large living room, kitchen and 2 separate bedrooms.
Nice and lovely location - close to Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh and Stedelijk museums. Walking distance to Vondelpark.
We really like our staying in Amsterdam!"
1339705;21668945;2014-10-21;10144902;Linsey;Our host, Mechtelien, was brilliant.  Neither our check-in nor our check-out went quite to plan (our fault, not hers) and she was flexible, accommodating and just generally brilliant. It makes such a difference to have a warm welcome from a host that genuinely loves her city (and speaks perfect English). The apartment was just lovely: comfortable and modern, but with lots of period detail and interesting features. The neighbourhood was gorgeous: peaceful and calm, but with lots of places to eat, endearing brown cafes and quirky antique shops. Highly recommended.
1339705;38455370;2015-07-15;15874757;Vishare;The apartment is stylish, comfortable and in a picture perfect location to walk to the museums and explore neighborhoods.  The hosts Mechtelein and Mark were kind and helpful. A nice treat were the passes to the Rijks Museum provided by the host. What a find! We hope to stay here again.
1339705;113651709;2016-11-13;70801984;Rayan;The neighbourhood was great and the apartment splendid. Thank you for hosting us.
9146453;56550707;2015-12-14;48074168;Aurore;"Un appartement très très bien situé, tout s'est très bien passé, nous avons été accueilli avec une bouteille de vin.
Les escaliers étaient en effet très petits mais nous nous y sommes fait, et le fait que l'appartement soit au dessus du salon de tatouage et qu'il faille passer par la n'a pas été dérangeant du tout !
Seul petit bémol la rue était très bruyante dans la nuit de samedi a dimanche et l'immeuble étant ancien on entendait tout.
Encore merci pour tout Akko, je recommande vivement :)"
9146453;64568960;2016-03-05;8666331;Orrin;Great location and a nice place - super dutch feel.
9146453;78090463;2016-06-05;33999733;Anis;the location is awesome! the place is big and clean. we had a very good time, i fully recommend.
9146453;101176490;2016-09-12;17215338;Matthias;Es war ein super Aufenthalt. Akko ist ein netter und äusserst unterhaltsamer Gastgeber und wir kommen gerne wieder in dieses kleine aber feine Häuschen.
9146453;105321485;2016-10-01;19762327;Martin;Vi havde et fint ophold og fik hjælp som det var nødvendigt.
9146453;109544922;2016-10-22;41459482;Bram;Fijn onthaal door Akko zelf die bezig was met een klant, even pauze, en ging allemaal heel vlotjes, goed beschreven advertentie die in't echt ook klopt. En dan de ligging die gewoon echt wel goed is, overal snel bij met de fiets! Ik kom zeker daar nog eens terug.
9146453;133899437;2017-02-25;65516086;Camille;Un très bel appartement dans le centre d'Amsterdam juste à coté du tram. Akko nous a bien renseigné pour trouver l'appartement le plus facilement possible et notre accueil s'est très bien passé. Un superbe séjour à Amsterdam.
1541068;88117235;2016-07-23;7669145;Rene Und Susanne;We were welcomed by very kind neighbours and the appartement was nice and calm. We appreciated the location out of the city and the drive through the vondel park with our bikes. Everything was like leon and natasha wrote and we would everytime come again to this beatyfull city!
10874596;110456417;2016-10-26;21452185;Advanced Persistent Traveller;"The apartment is located in a great little neighbourhood! Plenty of great restaurants and a two grocery stores close by. It's even quiet at nigh (by Amsterdam standards). Walking to the centre is only 20min and much quicker on the tram. Just a fantastic location.

The apartment itself is a bit more used than it appears in the photos (couches could maybe use a bit of a clean) but it is still very nice. The split levels are great for controlling the noise if someone wants to sleep in. The kitchen is fully equipped and there are two washers and dryers for cloths! 

Overall I would definetly recommend this place!"
10874596;131051600;2017-02-10;32993345;Kevin;You have to check this place where out people. Easy to get to, excellent places to go at night and in the day. Stairs are a little steep upto the 2nd floor aside from that we gave it 9.75/10 and I am a big moaner so book this place for sure
414865;72060907;2016-04-30;33045565;Leonoor;Prima verblijf gehad in een gezellig apartement in een leuke buurt en met een mooie tuin, waar ik helaas vanwege het weer maar weinig gebruik van heb kunnen maken.  Zeker een aanrader!
414865;80028630;2016-06-15;5182198;Annie;My parents, who are in their 70s, stayed for the second year in a row at Miranda's. As usual, the place was very clean, and she made my family feel welcomed. The back garden area is big and gets lots of light, and we ate dinner out there several times. The location is perfect because it is close to shops and restaurants and public transportation, but on a quiet street and so there was almost no noise. My parents would definitely stay there again.
15091889;104343525;2016-09-26;87906376;Haseeb;Amazing hospitality, great place and value for money.
15091889;131369824;2017-02-12;16826521;Jia (John);Big room, close to the no. 4 Tram. 4 stops from RAI. 8 stops from the Dam and all the attractions.
1197874;6275498;2013-08-06;5818785;Fiona;Wieneke was amazingly friendly and helpful. She was extremely inviting and made us feel very much at home at her place. Would highly recommend to anyone.
1197874;10845171;2014-03-10;11994590;Michelle;"Wieneke its a lovely host, very helpful, patient and fun. She help us with Everything ... Home is very cutie and very well organized, is located in an area with easy access a many stores. 
I had a great stay and recommend to all."
1197874;11582460;2014-04-08;11712212;Jody;This was one of the best places we have stayed at in Europe. Easy on and off Bus 21 from in front of the train station then 15 minutes later you're within 300 yards of her building. Wieneke is very helpful and can direct you to appropriate bus/tram or site. We wanted to take her bed home it was so comfortable. Heads up - the staircase is maximally narrow and steep like most old Dutch staircases, and the bathroom is also very compact with a 1930s era toilet.  The Turkish market or supermarket next door have good food choices for cooking your own.
1197874;13315089;2014-05-25;9642695;Nader;Wieneke is the perfect host! Very kind and helpful, she made us feel right at home. We stayed there for six days. The house is not far from the center. We loved the balcony: green and sunny. I totally reccommend it. Thank you very much and hope to see you soon!
1197874;25172557;2015-01-08;1161630;Ksenia;All the reviews regarding Wieneke and her apartment were an absolutely true! She is a wonderful host and an extremely caring person. We felt like at home from the first minute we came to her apartment. She even made us scones in the morning! The flat is charming as well as the room which is more than comfortable and super clean. Wieneke you are the best!
1197874;63436305;2016-02-22;2328160;Bruce;"I had an excellent stay with Wieneke!

The apartment itself is in a really great neighbourhood, away from the busy-ness and sights of the city centre, that allowed me to have a more local experience.  And yet, when I wanted to reach the city centre it was only a 10 - 15 min cycle away, or slightly longer with the tram.  The room is spacious, comfortable and private.

Wieneke is a great host and incredibly friendly.  She is intelligent and makes great conversation whether its shooting the shit, or politics.  I felt that she wanted to genuinely engage with me.

Wieneke has high ratings for a reason.  Hesitate not to book your stay at this gem of a place!"
9839452;139596324;2017-03-26;120367348;Alexander;"We spent a night at Japser's house and it was great. Everything was just like we imagined it we had a wonderful sunrise on the rooftop :D
Jasper is a cool and fun guy and we can really recommend this spot! You will have a good time there!

Apartment is just perfect:
- spacy

- with fully equiped kitchen and all the facilities you can imagine
- lovely private garden with chill area and barbeque.
Nearby area is every lovely, and it takes max 10 minutes to all you need: supermarket, cafe, tram stop, Amsterdamse Bos.
Hihgly recommend Monique and her lovely aps!"
14997560;105823458;2016-10-03;95841960;Dominic;"Thanks a lot for the nice stay in Amsterdam. The apartment is really great and perfect for a little group of friends or a family. It's very comfortable, well furnished  and is located in a good spot in the western part of the town. 
Linda is a great host. She will welcome you  warmly and tell you everything you need to know for your trip!
I would always recommend it!"

His apartment is great. And the location is perfect, easy way to reach all the places."
5042861;46625034;2015-09-12;40868070;Claudio Carlo Antonio;Joel was a perfect host. He receive us with a good wine. The indications that we receive were precisely. The apartment was perfect in each way. Thank you so much for everything Joel, your city is just grate!
5042861;57530167;2015-12-27;31838703;Ramya;"Joel's flat was very conveniently located, with several tram stops nearby. Unfortunately, we never met Joel but he was very easily reached by phone. The apartment was clean and well maintained and Joel was very flexible with our check-in check-out time (greatly appreciated)!! 

The only con would be the bathroom. When you shower, the ENTIRE bathroom gets wet. There isn't any sort of separation between the sink, the toilet or the shower -- it's all one space and the entire bathroom floor, toilet, etc get drenched. It dries out just fine, just a bit awkward is all.

Other than the bathroom, the stay was wonderful. Thank you Joel!!"
5042861;66733763;2016-03-24;18980770;Patriola;"Joel is a good host. We didn't know him, but everything was perfect when we arrived there. The home was clean and we have some chocolate in our beds and the bottle of champagne in the fridge. The house is better than in the pictures, but we have to enter through the computer shop. 

The heat doesn't work good and one of the days the house was very cold. We spoke to Joel and in the following day, the house was warm.

It is located close to the centrum and we have direct line to Amsterdam Central! 

Our neighbors are very noisy in the mornings, but only until they left the home. The supermarket is 3 minutes walking and you can find many restaurants and shops around.

It was a great trip!"
5042861;69672513;2016-04-12;14286098;Adriana;Joel was really nice host, even that we didn't meet him. I can imagine that life in Amsterdam is busy but he was always reachable and helpful. The apartment is really nice and its bigger than it looks in the pictures. I don't think the entrance from the computers store it's a problem, because it`s easy to find. The location is perfect, close to many trams lines and also close to the vondelpark, which is a beautiful park. And to the museumplein, the square with important museums like the Van Gogh museum and the I Amsterdam sign, which is 15 minutes walk. Also the apartment is 3 minutes walk from the supermarket and is close to bars and coffee places. Joel left to us chocolates and a bottle of champagne, which made our stay more special. I really like Joel`s apartment and I'll definitely book there again. It's the perfect combination between location, comfort and price. I highly recommend it!
5042861;95555081;2016-08-20;14759767;Rebecca;We had a really good stay here, really good location, close to public transport, clean, perfect for a couple. Enjoyed the bottle of champagne on arrival and chocolates on pillows, we thought this was a nice touch. We didn't mind the entrance through the computer shop, no hassle at all!
5042861;99555129;2016-09-05;13136411;Peggy;Be sure that you can climb a ladder before staying here, basically that's what you have to climb to access the apartment.
4168426;48947735;2015-09-29;28214916;Stefan;I had a pleasant stay in a nice apartment, quite well-located right at the Vondelpark, still in Oud-West. Stephan arranged everything well and was a good host.
4168426;70318488;2016-04-17;12277553;Vasil;The apartment is situated in a nice and safe neighborhood, between two amazing parks. Destination is easy reachable by walking or public transport, many food spots and shops there. Everything was great during our stay and I would like to recommend staying at Stephan's place.
13723769;101161101;2016-09-12;40389489;John;I stayed here for the weekend with a co-worker. We loved the house, very modern and clean. The architecture of the entire neighborhood is very unique. We rented bikes the entire weekend and the ride to downtown to the apartment is easy as pie. Since the owners of the house were not in town, their friend assisted us with keys and suggestions. Everything was great!
13723769;108443323;2016-10-16;91881558;Helen;"We had such a brilliant long weekend in this amazing house. Three of us - us and our 1yo baby - stayed. The house is beautiful, and the area around it is an architectural gem; so much striking and inspiring modern architecture to see.

We were warmly welcomed by Anouk and communication up to and during our stay was brilliant; we had very clear guidance about how to get from the airport to the house (easy) and she was very generous in recommending things to do and answering questions.

I'd really recommend this house to anyone who wants to be in the city but who also wants a bit of peace/quiet. It's a very easy journey to the centre (10-15 mins on a bus that leaves from very nearby the house) so you have the best of both worlds.

Thank you!"
3431653;54735883;2015-11-23;5665477;Anna;"Lineke's apartment is incredible. It really is one of the nicest apartments/air bnbs I have ever stayed in. 
It was more than accommodating, it has everything you need from cooking ingredients to cleaning products. 
Not only this, but Lineke is a fantastic host. I've never corresponded so much before with a host, and it helps so much - I felt like I could ask for anything and she would be there to answer. There are loads of maps and recommendations provided which are all really useful. 

The apartment was really easy to find, great location! It's interior is lovely and the sofa and beds are so comfortable it makes it hard to leave. We didn't leave the house till the afternoon everyday as we loved the apartment so much.  
Great bonus's like the amazing TV and sound system along with Netflix makes it really hospitable and better than any hotel. 

I highly recommended staying here it'll make your Amsterdam visit complete like it did ours. I cant imagine staying anywhere else!"
3431653;99481388;2016-09-05;7555421;Bethan Gwenllian;This is an absolutely lovely apartment. Spacious and very clean and it is located only about 10 minutes from the centre of Amsterdam. Lineke was a great hostess, she responded very quickly to any queries we had and when we arrived there was a list of restaurant and bar recommendations that was very helpful. We loved our stay in this apartment and the fact that we had such a cosy, comfortable base to come back to after a long day's exploring Amsterdam made our stay even nicer. Highly recommended.

Rundherum alles super! 
Auch der Kontakt vorher und vor Ort sehr nett!

Sorry for my late reply!
We really had a good time in Amsterdam in your apartment.
Hope to be back again  soon.Hope to meet you next time.
Friends, I recomand you this place!
Near Central Station,Good region,Easy connections."

Conforme au descriptif et répondant parfaitement à notre attente."
664697;32698383;2015-05-20;31377222;Ann;"We thought we will be getting a very clean place but the condition of the place was subpar. Tub was filthy(we had chosen the place because of the tub, thinking we could have soak ourselves after a day of shopping) we could not do that ""AT ALL""! The furnitures were dilapidated, one of the leg of the Ottoman was missing and was not mentioned at all. The fabric of the chair was broken and  simply covered with a piece of cloth. In sum, everything was pretty dirty. There was a nice kitchen but all the pots and pan and appliances were old and in bad conditions. The worst was within a few hours of check in the host ask if she can bring a man who is interested to rent the place to come over and see the place. We are two female traveling together and the request make us feel very uncomfortable. We did not know if she did bring the person by ( we were out at the time) but thought that was unprofessional. We paid more then 1000 euro to stay over for 5 nights, the overall conditions of the place was disappointing, will not recommend or stay there again."
664697;64003127;2016-02-28;36738913;Lauren;Apartment was very good. Good location and was in a nice quite block of apartments. Location was excellent, boats run every five minutes to the centre. Balcony looks out over the water, very pretty at night. Would recommend.

1266433;28935147;2015-04-01;13905393;Jesse & Talli;Our experience here was excellent. Could not have asked for better hosts. This is a great location! Everything is within walking distance and also close to the public transportation. We can't wait to come back and would definitely stay here again!
1266433;29656192;2015-04-11;8669892;Andy;"We had a lovely stay with Sander and his wife in Amsterdam.  They were great hosts, and made our visit to the city very special.  The room is located in a very central area, with nothing more than a 20-minute walk away, and is very picturesque, being on the canal.  This particular accommodation was a bit of a departure from the kind we usually book through Airbnb, in that it was a single room (+ bathroom) located within the home of the owner.  But this did not matter as we had our own separate entrance and thus plenty of privacy.  We would definitely recommend that any single person or couple looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam stay with Sander and his wife; they are a great couple and have a beautiful home."
1266433;31942582;2015-05-12;20784921;Lauren;Sander and his wife are lovely people and made us feel welcome from the start! The library's location is convenient to everything and in a quiet, peaceful part of Amsterdam. Highly recommend!
1266433;35161073;2015-06-15;21971167;Benjamin;Accueil excellent et présentation très complète de la ville et des endroits clés. La chambre est très calme et l'endroit très bien situé dans la ville.

Sander and his wife are very polite and kind!! Definitely would be back!! They even let us leave our baggage there until we took our train!!
1266433;38101506;2015-07-13;29293208;Dianna;Sander was great! He helped with everything that was needed to know about the area. Very responsive and detailed host. Everything was great!

Really really really nice homeowners!
They gave us awesome advices from culture to dinning, so if u want to stay in Amsterdam take this apartment :)"
1266433;39287236;2015-07-22;29317022;Lindsey;"My boyfriend and I were very happy with our stay in ""The Library"". Sanders and his wife were extremely welcoming upon our arrival. They sat with us and gave us a full breakdown of Amsterdam and key places to go, which was really helpful because we only had one full day there. Their place was in an extremely convenient location and we walked everywhere. We had an early flight and they offered to arrange a cab for us which was very nice as well. They are an exceptional nice couple and we really appreciated the warm welcome and hospitality."
1266433;64576769;2016-03-05;28211383;Annabel;"Bonne situation (central, canaux, etc...).
J'ai trouvé pourtant le prix cher pour le service rendu."
1266433;67372359;2016-03-29;24964097;Florence;Accueil chaleureux et sympathique de la part de nos hôtes d'exception, Sander et Marijke. Sander a pris le temps de nous donner de précieux conseils sur les points  phares de la ville (en nous remettant un plan, devenu notre compagnon de route). La chambre est conforme aux photos. Spacieuse, bien équipée. La salle de bain petite mais suffisante. Le tout est très propre, la cour intérieur est très agréable. Aucune nuisance sonore. L'entrée indépendante est un point fort. Elle donne de plus sur un canal où tout est à proximité. Lieu recommandé à 100% !
1266433;77464022;2016-06-01;10718992;Hassene;The Library looks exactly like the in the photos. It has everything one would need. The hosts are just superb. You'll instantly feel that you've found your own place in Amsterdam. The neighbourhood is the finest in the city. Will book it again next time in Amsterdam.
1266433;80805223;2016-06-19;21948203;Wolfgang;"It was my second time at ""The Library"" and these are the reasons:
1) Perfect location (you really get a ""Amsterdam feeling"")
2) It's quiet and clean
3) Friendly and caring hosts. They really want you to be happy while staying with them.

Conclusion: book it!"

The Library is clean and quiet room with own bathroom and outside patio. Location is in the centre of city, so all atractions are in walking distance, if you are tired you can use trams, stops are close to Library.  It was great stay in Amsterdam and we hope, that we will come back someday."
1266433;95760189;2016-08-20;46174039;Emily;This is a quiet, cozy space in a great location. We were able to walk to all the sights easily. The private patio was a plus...very romantic! Our hosts were very friendly and helpful and gave us great advice and a useful map. Thank you for helping to make our honeymoon so wonderful!
1266433;97518258;2016-08-27;57694042;MitchelljMitchellj;"My girlfriend and i spent 3 nights in ""The Library"" what a wonderful stay we had. We both couldnt speak anymore highly of our hosts. Communication was efficient and they made us feel right at home even did some of our washing. Perfect location. ps. Amsterdam is an amazing city, highly recommend!"
1266433;98194614;2016-08-29;69044717;Carly;"We had a great time and really enjoyed our stay. Sander & Marijke, are great hosts with so much advice and suggestions on what to see and do in Amsterdam. We found the location prefect for seeing all areas of the city. It is within easy walking distance for nights out and to all the must see sights. We would definitely look to stay here again on our next visit to Amsterdam! 
Best wishes... Carly & Christian"
1266433;102037765;2016-09-16;74019673;Pat;Sander & his wife were very welcoming, and showed us numerous places to go and things to do in our short time in Amsterdam. The place is comfortable, cozy, and clean. Excellent for one or two people. We'll definitely stay here next time we're in Amsterdam, and you should too.
1266433;110382941;2016-10-25;10971321;Ravid;Amazing hosts! Help with anything you need. They gave us a feeling that we were part of the family. The library is fantastic and very very quiet. Perfect place to stay if you're visiting Amsterdam we will definitely be returning!
1266433;113858387;2016-11-14;100933314;Maira;"We were in Amsterdam for a day and stayed at Sander's place. Sander's library room was really cozy and well equipped. Made us feel like we were living in a home away from home
Highly recommended for anyone thinking of staying right by the canal."
1266433;123902278;2016-12-31;88015774;Alice;"The "" Library"" was just perfect for us. Even before we arrived the communication we had made us feel confident that our stay was going to be great. When we arrived Sanders and Marijke welcomed us and we immediately felt at home. Their shared their local knowledge of their community and as a result we had some amazing food! Our accommodation was clean comfortable, warm and cosy and we had everything we needed. It felt so cool to have our own keys to this amazing building and be able to come and go like locals. Its no surprise they are ""superhosts""  they really are in every ."
1266433;124094481;2017-01-01;24194347;Rebecca;"I really can't say enough good things about The Library - the location is wonderful, the space is peaceful, private and included everything (and more than) described. Sander and Marijke were probably the kindest, most knowledgable hosts we have experienced with Airbnb (and we've had some amazing hosts!). They know so much about their city, and we really appreciated the time they took on arrival to share that knowledge with us. 

We found the location ideal - we were able to walk within 5-25 minutes to everything we'd hoped to see, and if we hadn't fancied walking, public transport was close by and easy to use. There are plenty of great cafes, pubs and restaurants in the area, and a small supermarket a few minutes away (with a fridge in the apartment) if required. 

I'd highly recommend staying at the Library if you're planning a visit to Amsterdam!"
1266433;131710027;2017-02-13;9351369;Srikanth;"A fantastic canal house right in the middle of historical Amsterdam. Plenty of attractions within a walking distance. Tram station is a minute away. 
Sander and Marjike are truly super hosts who helped us with our huge luggage during the check-in, told us everything about the city, the important places to see and gave us plenty of suggestions about where to shop and where to eat. 
The library room has an eclectic collection of books. Even if you don't go out, you can have a great time reading the books ;)

Highly recommended!"
1025482;4548340;2013-05-12;5551755;Manuela;"We really enjoyed our holidays in Reinhart and Viveka's Housboat. It is close to the central station (about 500 airmeters), ferry transport all night (frequently, for free and fun!), perfect location and beautiful garden. Instead of hearing the noise of the city, you hear the birds singing and instead of seeing big buildings, you see the water and the green surrounding. Just beautiful and all you need to relax. We would stay again there. Except for the 3 minutes ferry ride everything was reachable by foot.
Reinhart and Viveka were really friendly and uncomplicated. We highly recommend staying with them!"
1025482;4905759;2013-06-01;3432929;Pedro;"Reynhart and Viveka are incredible hosts. They make us feel at home at their home-boat.
They welcomed us like they were old friends and let us join their life in a very charm and polite way, sharing talks when they could and being extremelly friendly and easy going all the time.
Don't miss the oportunity to know them."
1025482;5710230;2013-07-13;6129156;Michael;"Staying on Reinhart and Viveka's houseboat was an absolutely amazing experience!  The accommodation was so comfortable, and being rocked to sleep at night by the gentle ebb and flow of the canal was awesome.  I cannot say enough about the extensive breakfast that was prepared for us each morning, and the location was such that we were only 10 minutes walk and a short ferry ride from the heart of the action, but at night it was like we were a million miles away.  Furthermore, Reinhart and Viveka were lovely people, and made us feel very welcome, with great conversation and suggestions for sightseeing in the area.  Thank you so much!

Michael and Theresa"
1025482;6658536;2013-08-20;7012021;Beth;Reinhart was a wonderful host! Breakfast was abundant and delicious, including fresh blackberries from the garden. We look forward to returning!
1025482;7135325;2013-09-08;7087355;Mary Ann;"We really enjoyed our stay on Reinhart's houseboat and would gladly return. Reinhart is a welcoming, helpful, interesting host. The space was comfortable and clean, and breakfast was quite substantial.
The location was excellent, taking the ferry back and forth was easy and fun. We especially enjoyed a wonderful restaurant that Reinhart recommended,Wilhelmina Doc, a short walk from the houseboat and right along the river.

1025482;7507823;2013-09-23;4454826;Diana;"Une très bonne idée pour profiter d'Amsterdam autrement. Loin des classique. Descendre du Thalys, monter en 2 minutes dans un bac et loger dans un woonboot. 
Peniche tout confort, un calme reposant pour un week-end loin de l'agitation parisienne.
Reinhart est adorable, n'en fait ni trop ni pas assez. 
Nous y retournerons."
1025482;7963332;2013-10-10;8429348;Regina;This is the best way to experience Amsterdam!  It is the perfect location to get away from the crowds of Amsterdam while still being literally only a few minutes walk from downtown.  Plus the houseboat is amazing -- serene, quiet, spacious and Reinhart was an excellent host.  Great breakfast too!
1025482;8291922;2013-10-24;7908076;Marine;Parfait ! Très agréable séjour sur ce bateau-maison à la belle déco. Chambre très propre donnant sur l'eau. Petit déjeuner copieux. Reinhardt, hôte très gentil. Que du positif. Très pratique également de faire les quelque 200 mètres qui conduisent au bateau gratuit qui en deux minutes nous fait arriver à la gare et de là aux quartiers les plus agréables de la ville. Nous avons dîné tous les soirs au Musée du cinéma The Eye pas loin de l'embarcadère. Cadre magnifique et cuisine fine.
1025482;8955114;2013-11-28;5146820;Madi;I can't recommend Reinhart's houseboat enough! We stayed three nights and from the get go he was very welcoming and hospitable. The houseboat is beautiful (excellent lighting!), the room is very comfortable with a beautiful view. It even comes with the most adorable cat named Dora. A great breakfast was prepared for us in our own little breakfast nook every morning. The location was perfect, very close to Amsterdam Centraal in a really interesting, up and coming neighborhood with a great, reliable, free ferry that brings you right to the station. Again, I can't recommed it enough!
1025482;10794838;2014-03-08;3407674;Sophie;"very nice houseboat and very nice guest
he lent us his IPhone charger which was very nice because we forgot ours
thanks !"
1025482;19918823;2014-09-21;8764618;Patricia;We absolutely loved the house boat stay.  It was a great location and we experienced what it is like to live among the local community more than a hotel stay.  The view of the city was great and the host was friendly, helpful and gave us lots of suggestions on things to do on our 3 night stay.
1025482;21725628;2014-10-22;22480954;Monique;"Hallo Reinhart, 

Bedankt voor je gastvrijheid. We zullen deze eerste airbnb ervaring niet snel vergeten. Een prachtige plek en ideaal gelegen om Amsterdam te bezoeken. Hartelijke groet Monique"
1025482;22810950;2014-11-15;17799064;David;Reinhart is a very friendly and nice host, we enjoyed staying at his place. The boat is lovely and situated just perfectly! Thanks!
1025482;25662561;2015-01-22;14759582;Françoise;"Reinhart is really a welcoming host.
The boat is beautiful. The neighbourhood is very calm but only 5 minutes from the center of Amsterdam. 
Perfect location.
I warmly recomment it"

1025482;35291149;2015-06-17;12938815;Robyn;"The houseboat is situated in a most ideal place for a traveller. It is easily accessible from the Centraal train station from which you can travel to anywhere. It is just a short (free) ferry ride away yet is so lovely and peaceful, you would not know the city is so close by. The view is great too, you can see the city and ships go by from the peaceful harbour. 
The houseboat is spacious and I loved sitting where the warm sunshine came through the window.
I really appreciated the generous breakfast made by Reinhart each day - yum!
Reinhart was available and helpful whenever I had questions. He was patient and kind. I had a most enjoyable stay."
1025482;39733880;2015-07-26;13119872;Anke;Wir hatten ein sehr schönes Wochenende in Amsterdam und auf dem Hausboot. Wir haben das Boot und den Schlüssel gut gefunden. Die Lage ist perfekt. Ruhig gelegen mit Blick auf Amsterdam. Die Anbindung zur Fähre ist optimal. Das Boot ist wie auf den Bildern abgebildet. Wir haben uns wohl gefühlt. Auch das Parken ca. 800 m entfernt war kein Problem für uns. Reinhart war nicht da, aber immer erreichbar und freundlich. Wir kommen gerne wieder.
1025482;61034345;2016-01-31;38574996;Ciara;My boyfriend and I had a really lovely stay at Reinhart's houseboat.   He was a wonderful host, very welcoming and helpful and the houseboat was very cosy and warm.  He also provided breakfast which was appreciated.  Was great to get a proper Amsterdam experience yet be so close to the centre of the city.  Def recommend and would stay again.
1025482;62168246;2016-02-12;53424914;Eric;Reinhart est très amical et accueillant. Le bateau est décoré avec gout et chaleureux, et la chambre confortable. Un petit îlot de verdure et de nature à 5 min en ferry de Central! Unique!

1025482;65936271;2016-03-18;19107971;Ashley;If you're looking for a quiet place to stay near the city center of Amsterdam, Reinhart's place is perfect! The room is large and comfortable - bed felt like a king size and there is a tv and mini fridge. You have your ow. Bathroom with a shower, tub, toilet and sink. The ferry is only a 2 minute walk down the street and very easy to get to - it takes you right into the city center. Reinhart was always willing to suggest places to eat and drink and was flexible helping us check in early.
1025482;69198964;2016-04-10;50275896;Stéphanie;"Merci encore à Reinhart pour son accueil et sa disponibilité (boite de chocolats), ainsi que pour sa discrétion.
La chambre était comme sur les photos et le lit confortable.
Le petit-déjeuner était très copieux et très bon, il manquait juste un petit jus de fruits...
Son français étant très bon c'était donc facile pour communiquer."

1025482;102137601;2016-09-16;28945606;Elaine;"Reinhart was friendly and approachable from the get go. Even though our stay was brief, he helped us in shaping our time in Amsterdam.

The room and bathroom were clean and spacious, the little nook area was clean, overall a real gem of a find. The location is just far enough away that you don't get the city noise, but just a short walk and ferry back to the main terminal and you are back in the thick of things. Highly recommend."
1025482;103486363;2016-09-22;25859441;Renato;We absolutely loved our stay on the house boat and in Amsterdam in general. The location is wonderful. Really close to the city centre and public transport, yet so quiet, private and peaceful. The house boat is divine. It's spacious and has a really large, comfortable bed. An amazing experience. We will definitely be back Amsterdam!
1025482;115166498;2016-11-22;51750970;Tim;"I can't recommend Reinhart's houseboat more. His description is spot on; it's a quiet, private and relaxing place for a getaway that has close (and free) access to the city. Breakfast was delicious, Reinhart was very helpful, and I felt extremely comfortable."
1025482;129354272;2017-01-30;21994025;Jörg;Thanks to Reinhart's help and hospitallity we had a great time at Amsterdam. His houseboat is perfectly located to visit the vivid city nearby and afterwards relax on his houseboad which is located in a calm neighborhood. Thank you Reinhart for your help with the concert tickets and see you on our next Amsterdam trip :-)

9058595;123625737;2016-12-30;2889489;Carmen;Yasien is a great host, he did everything to meet our needs and make sure our stay was pleasant. As he wasn't able to do the check-in, he arranged everything with his sister, who is very nice. The flat was spacious and central, close to many attractions. Downside would be that the flat is quite dark at night, one of the light in the living room seems broken per example. Would recommend a stay at Yasien's to conclude.
9058595;131430141;2017-02-12;30274900;Francesca;Yassien was extremely accommodating and has the unit waiting for us in perfect condition! Amazing location and very comfortable apartment.

La balade a velo entre l'embarcadère et la maison le long de petits canaux vaut le coup, et ne prend que 15/20 mn. Tout a fait faisable tous les jours.
Et ideal pour tous ceux qui souhaitent pouvoir visiter la ville sans avoir a supporter la pression touristique du centre ville.
Encore merci a Karin pour l'accueil, et la decouverte de ce petit coin tres original. Habitant moi meme a Amsterdam, et recevant souvent des amis qui cherchent un logement pour quelques jours, je sais que je reviendrai!"

9165626;64599865;2016-03-06;31900253;Romain;Inge's apartment is in a very nice neighborhood with all commodities around. It is quite far for the center by walk(50min) but acceptable with the tramway. The cleaning was not nice under the beds and there was some old cigarettes in a corner of the balcony. We had news from Inge 5 minutes after arrival in Amsterdam, it was quite late to us because I sent her lots of mail and sms the days before...
9165626;78192995;2016-06-05;55927032;Florian;"The apartment is very nice with much of space. The kitchen is great, the other rooms are nicely furnished. The area is fantastic, East Amsterdam is lively and many good places are in close walking distance. The center of Amterdam is 15 minutes away but the bus system works very well there.
Overall I was satisfied with the apartment and I can highly recommend it."
9165626;100639632;2016-09-10;87565487;Xavier;"No vimos al propietario en ningún momento. Nos dejó las llaves en un candado en la calle. Instrucciones para el apartamento en unas fotocopias, ninguna indicación sobre sitios para comprar; yo viajaba con 2 niños. Sólo encontramos un Lidl relativamente cerca.
El barrio está bien, pero no viven prácticamente holandeses, muchos inmigrantes que hicieron difícil comunicarnos con ellos.
Está un poco lejos del centro. Ropa y zapatos de los propietarios en los armarios. Comida empezada en frigorífico y despensa. 
En fin, el precio no era económico, esperaba más, sobretodo encontrar a  una persona como en anteriores experiencias con Airbnb a quién preguntar sobre el barrio, supermercados o restaurantes cerca, etc.
Un mapa de Amsterdam, en lugar de 2 fotocopias, etc.
No repetiré."

Le quartier et la maison étaient bien décrits.  
On se sentait chez soi, dans une maison qui avait le charme de l'ancien avec de l'espace (on occupait 2 étages) et de la lumière. On était dans dans un quartier calme, typiquement amstellodamois - pas envahi par les touristes :-) - mais tout de même à 2 coups de pédale du centre historique."

The apartment was very well decorated and had a lovely little balcony.  

It was well equipped with the things needed for a few nights stay.

The bed was extremely comfortable!

The 9 Streets locale is so beautiful, it was hard to leave because it is so quaint and peaceful along the canals.

Denise offered us a hair dryer and iron as we didn't have our own, and left us a lovely bottle of wine!

The few negative points:
The weather was really hot (30-32 degrees) and there was nothing to cool us down.  It would have been great to have a fan in the bedroom because the windows had to be closed as it was noisy at night outside.

The neighbours were quite noisy, but we weren't in too much for it to be a problem.

The apartment takes 4 people, but there were 3 of us and it was a bit of a struggle, especially with the limited bathroom size.

All in all, it was a fantastic location with the hosts being very welcoming and nothing was a bother.  Will definitely recommend!"
5925158;39173337;2015-07-21;34557649;Maria;El apartamento está situado en un barrio excepcional, cerca de todo, y muy tranquilo. La anfitriona fue muy amable en todo momento. La casa eso sí, se encontraba sucia, la tuvimos que limpiar,  y tuvimos la mala suerte de encontrar un ratón una noche, lo cual parece ser frecuente en Amsterdam. El baño muy estrecho. Lo mejor sin duda, su localización.
5925158;43279185;2015-08-18;6144401;Daniel;I stayed for two days with a colleague in Denise's apartment. It was a great time. Everything was perfect clean, the beds were comfy and big. Getting keys was very uncomplicated as Gerrit just needed to walk down. He is very kind and showed us everything. He also put a nice bottle of wine in the fridge. The location is great, as its in the heart of nine streets. So, lots of cafés, boutiques and galleries around. But although it's very central it is not noisy. I had the windows to the beautiful balcony open all night and slept like a baby. To conclude, I can totally recommend Denise and Gerrits apartment. I surely will come back one day.
5925158;49248654;2015-10-02;43005954;Steven;"Another great time in Amsterdam!

Place was perfect...could not of have been simpler, we met the host when we arrived and then met briefly when we left. No complaints at all!"

5925158;64523134;2016-03-05;28105624;Nermeen;This apartment was my favorite in Amsterdam. I loved the layout and cosiness and the record player was pretty awesome. So was Netflix...the only thing I can say is that a lot of the plates and cups in the cupboards were extremely dirty..but other than that perfect apartment
5925158;65336506;2016-03-13;6436956;Giovanna;Great weekend away using this homely spot as a base.  I was overly pleased with location and the attention to detail in the flat.  Definitely worth every penny
5925158;67602664;2016-03-30;49607244;Astrid;Geweldig appartementje! Alles was zoals beschreven. Een heel ordelijk appartement en zo'n leuke inrichting. Denise was zeer vriendelijk en open. De locatie was perfect, ik kon geen betere wensen. Een echte aanrader dus!

5925158;81755536;2016-06-24;21040087;Christopher;Wonderful hosts. Beautiful apartment. Fantastic neighborhood. There is a great market right at the corner as well. Overall this is the Airbnb experience that everyone hopes to have.
5925158;87773889;2016-07-21;26532927;Akshay;"First things first, this is a brilliant location; bang in the centre of the 9 streets with a super market a stone's throw away. The apartment itself is cosy and comfortable and homely with a super cute balcony overlooking an overgrown garden, it looks out of a storybook.  Now, as a host, Denise was amazing, what was amazing was the tiny attention to details that just goes above and beyond....a  plush cot for our son was provided,  extra towels for the entire stay, pots and pans to throw together a quick meal for a child, coffee capsules and just a good attitude. We had the pleasure of meeting her and her mum, both polite and friendly.  I hope to go back next year. Highly recommended, 2 thumbs up!!!!"
5925158;97126650;2016-08-26;10021244;Casey;The apartment was perfect for us and had all the necessary amenities. Located in the middle of a bustling neighborhood it was easy to enjoy a taste of Amsterdam. Slept wonderfully and would book again. Thank you!

15540054;114791714;2016-11-20;94849894;Kate;Aranka's place was great! The location is perfect right in the middle of the charming Jordaan area, with basically the whole city within walking distance.  The room is listed as a private room but really felt more like its own apartment due to the separate entrance.  Would definitely stay here again :)

The apartment was immaculate and very homely like a home away from home. We really loved staying at Tamar's and was surrounded by beautiful views which made it even more perfect.We had no problems at all, bed really comfy and lovely bathroom with plenty of hot water.

Thanks to you we were very happy and enjoyed staying Amsterdam!"

14314825;105783597;2016-10-02;27027325;Katie;Hadewych and her partner were excellent hosts. Their apartment was big and very clean, exactly like the pictures. Hadewych was in contact before we arrived and during our stay to make sure it was going well. We felt extremely welcome. The apartment is in a great location with lots of good restaurants around. We rented bikes and it was easy to cycle into the centre. There is a bakery opposite which was great on Saturday morning. I would not hesitate to stay at their place again.
14314825;108435828;2016-10-16;3434534;Bernat;"Too good to be true!!! Every marathoner's dream. To be just 5 minutes away from the start line. Priceless! Hadewych has been a wonderful host. Communication in been never easyer, even days before our trip.
She did everything on her hands to make us feel like home... or better!!!
Cozy apartment and so well connected to downtown  ans Schiphol airport with 197 bus.
Nice area with a supermarket 2 blocks away and a delicious bakery just across the street. 
We could not have choosen better.  :)"
9953753;62161388;2016-02-12;7705268;Katharina;"We had a wonderful stay in the cosy apartment of Marjolein. She was a perfect host. When we had questions, she answered right away. The flat itself is welcoming, homely, warm and clean, with a well equiped kitchen and a nice bathroom. The apartment is very well located in a peaceful area and you can walk  to a lot of sightseeing points.
We totally recommend Marjolein, and we hope to come back some day. Thank you very much, you felt us feel home."
9953753;66153325;2016-03-20;1090146;Ralf;It's been a wonderful experience in Amsterdam. The apartment is super centrally located and you can walk anywhere or just rent a bike to any of the attractions or sights. Our host has been very welcoming into this beautiful and well renovated  place with a great kitchen and bathroom. We especially loved the details like the small balcony, gas oven or cute fireplace. I mean the bathroom even has floor heating. It's a place where you can feel at home, live like you are a local yourself and just enjoy the atmosphere. I would like to come back sometimes.
9953753;67365109;2016-03-29;13284704;Martha;The host canceled this reservation 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The apartment is fully equipped : Television, Ipod station, coffee machine...
Brigitte wasn't available to welcome us but her very nice neighbour gave us keys and full instructions. 
The apartment is located in a peaceful area. A supermarket is located at 5 minutes by walk. You also get a tram station (N°2) at about 5 minutes by walk. You can be at Leidseplein in 12 minutes. 

We were very happy to stay into Brigitte's appartment and if we come to Amsterdam, we will for sure, contact Brigitte."
1141047;15218932;2014-07-05;15553981;Ellen;The host Brigitte was very easy to communicate with, fast response and very helpful in answering all our queries. The apartment was as described and was very good for our needs (a 1yr old included). Would recommend and would return.

Fijn dat het appartement op de begane grond is en ook de grote tuin is fijn. Alle huishoudelijke zaken zijn aanwezig, incl. vaatwasser. Het appartement ligt dichtbij winkels en restaurants in de buurt, alsmede bij openbaar vervoer faciliteiten. Het is een rustige buurt. 

Prima locatie voor 3 personen om Amsterdam te verkennen."

We would definitely like to stay there again :) Even our former doubt that the apartment is not located centrally enough, turned out to be wrong, because due to the trams we were very close to the city center and its sightseeing points, but still lived in a calm and likely neighbourhood! Thanks again to Brigitte, we had a wonderful stay :))
1141047;38102019;2015-07-13;16814360;Nathalie;We had an amazing trip to Amsterdam, due largely to the great apartment we were in. The apartment is beautiful, well maintained and   corresponds to the pictures and the description on the website. We enjoyed having the garden in the backyard so our son could play outside. I would rent this apartment again when we go back to Amsterdam next time.
1141047;47706374;2015-09-21;40729166;Oliver;"Die Wohnung war sehr schön eingerichtet und durch die kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten wie z.B Teelichter sehr ansprechend. 
Für drei Personen war die Wohnung gut geeignet. 
Das Wohnviertel ist sehr angenehm, ruhig und trotzdem hat man in wenigen Minuten Shops und Restaurants zur Verfügung!
Sehr schön!"

The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, and yet very close to the Vondelpark and not too far from the city centre. 
What I really appreciated is being among true locals, away from the tourist crowds."
7645716;86063398;2016-07-14;13811467;Teija;My boyfriend and I really enjoyed at stay at Dennis' apartment! It was small, but perfect for our busy tourist stay. Dennis was very accommodating and had everything set up for us when we got there. He was easy to reach and quick to respond when needed. The location was just outside the city central in a very cute neighbourhood, making it the perfect crash pad for peaceful evenings. We had a blast and would highly recommend.
7645716;87724932;2016-07-21;42238304;Kaitlyn;"We would recommend staying at Dennis' place. The apartment is in a great location. It is a few minutes walk to the tram and 15 minute ride into the city centre. Supermarket around the corner and the kitchenette has facilities available to cook including crockery.

Checkout is flexible because you don't need anyone present to check out. You just drop your key in the letterbox.

Dennis provides an ipad for use in the apartment. Wifi connection strong.

You will share the bathroom with Dennis but you won't see him around so if you are looking for a private place this is still suitable.

We had an issue with one of our suitcase locks and Dennis was willing to help and was contactable on his phone. We really appreciated it as it was potentially an inconvenience for him.

Only thing to note is that no toaster or kettle is provided in the kitchenette but there is a nespresso machine.

We really recommend staying here."
7645716;90026014;2016-07-30;64560707;Holly;Wonderful stay at Dennis'. He was so accommodating, the flat was spotless and the location was ideal for getting in and out of Amsterdam central. Would have loved to stay longer and would definitely stay again!

le logement était à la hauteur de nos attentes: le lit d'appoint était très confortable , la vue sur le canal, le coté cosy et chaleureux de l'appartement, excepté un petit soucis avec l'écoulement de la douche, 
un appartement un peu atypique sympathique...
situé non loin du centre ville et bien placé à coté d'un quartier jeune et animé, vous avez toutes commodités proches, courses, location de vélo...
pour ceux qui rechercherait des chaines tv internationales par contre il n'y a que des hollandaises mais aussi des radios !
je le recommande nous y avons passé un bon moment !"

With great coffee available in the room w/ delicious cookies! Her home is perfectly located in out skirts of a beautiful park and all the main attractions. Sophie was the most thoughtful guest providing awesome functional bikes to cruise the town in! Totally recommend a booking w her, don't hesitate! I will be back! Thank you Sophie!
637761;23647285;2014-12-07;13017310;Linda;Deze locatie van Sophie is echt een aanrader! De kamer was erg ruim en netjes en precies zoals op de foto's. De ligging is prima. In de omgeving zijn veel restaurantjes en ontbijt/lunchtentjes, maar je bent ook zo in het centrum. Het Vondelpark is om de hoek en binnen een paar minuten ben je op het Leidsplein. Erg handig dat er fietsen beschikbaar zijn. Sophie reageerde iedere keer heel snel op de berichtjes en gaf goede tips over parkeren. Ze was heel flexibel in de aankomsttijd en de dag van vertrek konden we onze spullen later ophalen, zodat we die niet mee hoefden nemen de stad in.

Bij aankomst wachtte me een korte welkomstboodschap een keurig schoon appartement. Heerlijk geslapen in het comfortabele bed. Zelf ben ik op het overnachten na amper in het appartement geweest, maar de zeer grote woonkamer en gezellige keuken zijn voorzien van alle benodigdheden om ook van een langer verblijf een prettige ervaring te maken.
Een prachtige locatie dichtbij het Vondelpark met een goede tramverbinding naar het centrum op 100 meter lopen."

Het contact met Pauline verliep soepel en ze was erg flexibel met het in- en uitchecken. 
Een aanrader!"
6734900;69453581;2016-04-11;59942090;Alison;Pauline thanks for being so flexible about checkin and checkout times - it was so nice not to have to manage luggage in an unfamiliar city. The location was great - in the center of things close to bars, coffee shops and restaurants but quiet too. A great introduction for us to Airbnb. Alison
6734900;94309344;2016-08-15;47411904;Matthieu;Great appartment with a very good location. The street is calm but near from all you need (grocery,  bike rental,  tram, good restaurants). Pauline was very kind with us and her appartment was perfect for a week and specially for 2. We felt like home !

Large enough to feel very cosy, so close to the city center and, best of all, the terrace  where you can relax and enjoy a drink in the evening.

Booking the apartment and communication in general went very smooth, we had a couple of friends coming earlier than anticipated and Sandra arranged so they could stay in the apartment."
2750373;21512910;2014-10-19;12428098;Rene;The appartement is very lovely and there is enough space for five persons. A tram-station and a supermarket are near to the appartement. We had some nice days in Amsterdam.

2215021;31096783;2015-05-02;27058572;Brooke;Annemieke was very welcoming and helpful. The apartment was just as described and was comfortable for our family. The neighborhood was safe feeling with Museums and restaurants within a quick walk.
2215021;35793003;2015-06-22;2511515;Olivier;Attractive apartment close to museums. Warm welcome
2215021;66514963;2016-03-22;35460883;Thomas;"Très bel appartement bien situé!
L'accueil d'Annemieke et son mari a été très chaleureux."
2215021;76657470;2016-05-28;54179492;Andy;My wife and I stayed at Annemieke's apartment for three nights and it was absolutely perfect for us. The neighbourhood of De Pijp was a great location to stay in, with the museums and the city centre close by, whilst also having a less touristy, residential feel. The apartment itself was very comfortable, clean and tidy, and our host was very helpful, but also gave us the freedom to feel like real Amsterdam residents. We will definitely be back!
2215021;111661929;2016-11-01;40963616;Kai;"Beautiful apartment at the best place in town, next to the rijksmuseum and many other museums, next to the biggest shopping street and just a few minutes to walk to the oldtown. It was amazing. We have just stayed for a weekend, but it was perfect. The apartment war really nice and for 2 persons big enough. If you want to cook, the kitchen is not really big enough, but tea and coffee is possible to make. But you have many restaurants around the corner. 
Annemieke was lovely showing us everything and helped us to find a parking place which was really cheap. Thanks a lot and we will be definitely back. Cheers"
2215021;120588148;2016-12-11;19387009;Berit Helene;"First time in Amsterdam and I didn't exactly know where to stay or what to expect. I searched airbnb and suddenly came across Annemieke's superb apartment. The reviews was great, the location looked good, not far from the city center but far enough away to have a bit of quiet and peace. 

It's close to many museums, brewery, bars and pubs. Many great restaurants just around the corner and the neighborhood is quiet but hip, cool and have a good atmosphere. We felt totally safe there being two girls traveling, and Annemieke and her husband live next door if there's anything.

Our hosts gave us enough information before we arrived. We got the key on time and we felt like our hosts wanted this to be our home away from home. The apartment was clean, warm, homeish and really cosy. A tiny kitchen with refrigerator, cooking plates and other kitchen stuff was enough for us. The bathroom was super, enough towels and som other stuff like soap, shampoo or other articles if you fex managed to leave something behind at home. The bedroom had a 1.20 bed (?) and it was really, really comfortable. We slept like two babies :) A small dining table as well. The living room had a tv and a sofa and a temperature regulator we could turn up and down as we would.

All in all we had a fantastic stay and we'll definitely try to stay here the next time we're heading to Amsterdam.

Thank you so much :)"
1068565;11627309;2014-04-09;13536305;Piers;Petra was a very pleasant host and was also very helpful. She showed us where we could rent bikes and how to get around the city. Her flat was also very clean and nicely decorated with very comfortable sleeping arrangements.
1068565;31041920;2015-05-01;22055837;Thecle;Very good experience, the place is quiet and charming. Petra s a really nice person. She gives explanations about what to  visit. We have access to all accommodation in her house that is well maintained. We were near the central station (12minutes by tram). It is a good place when you have children, it allows to go to the city-center easily and come back for lunch if you want or you can stay downtown. there are lots of things to visit and our child enjoy the place.
1068565;37557159;2015-07-08;1138822;Lisa;"We were four adults (my mom, my two sisters and myself) who stayed at Petra's for four nights. The place was very easy to get to with public transportation, and we really enjoyed the opportunity to go swimming just outside the garden door (it is a great way to start and finish the day). 

The apartment is big and airy, and we were quite comfortable with the double-bed and two spare matresses. Petra was very kind and welcoming, and made sure we had all the information we needed. She was also easily reachable during our stay. 

It is a nice place to come back to after a long day of strolling the hot Amsterdam streets, and with good shopping facilities only one tram stop away, I would definitely recommend the apartment for anyone going to Amsterdam."
1068565;70800899;2016-04-20;18916065;Natalie;Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse : Petra est une excellente hôtesse, la maison est très agréable et bien placée à  15 mn de la gare centrale. Quartier super calme, supermarché a proximité... A ne pas manquer. !
1068565;74982633;2016-05-17;61357775;Alberto;"Hem passat uns dies meravellosos a l'apartament de Petra. L'acollida va resultar perfecte, tot i que Petra no va poder ser-hi. El seu veí Rob ens va mostrar tot el que necessitàvem. Petra va tenir un gran detall  de benvinguda amb un vi i unes molt bones galetes. 
L'apartament és ampli, acollidor i és tal i com apareix a l'anunci. Tenir l'opció de fer-te un bany de bon matí al canal és molt atractiu.
Està a un barri molt tranquil i a 15' del centre.
En definitiva, una gran experiència molt recomanable."
1068565;77976335;2016-06-04;47678601;Sam;"We felt a little nervous when we first arrived as we were driving (without satnav and with children) and missed the turning on IJBurg. Petra was very patient and helped us find where we were going by phone, then met us by the apartment building. A wonderful host, Petra showed us around and gave us some tips on where to go, including a suggestion to walk across the bridge and to eat at Camping Zeeburg, which we did for breakfast in the sun, it was beautiful! 

The apartment is a stylish, calm and airy space. It is perfect to be by the water but feel connected to the city - you can watch the cars on the bridges in the distance. The neighbourhood is wonderful - we loved walking to the tram past all the individually designed houses, with the bikes parked outside with children's furniture and chalk drawings, so much character. Our kids could play out on the grass and we all enjoyed sitting on the little jetty to feed the ducks and dip our feet. The boys in the family jumped from the bridge (right outside the flat) into the lake and loved it!

The living area is very spacious, just like the pictures but even nicer. The bedroom is restful (love the turquoise curtains) and there is ample space to have the two mattresses there or as we did in the living room. We cooked a few good meals in the kitchen which has everything you could possibly need. Petra thoughtfully left wine and treats - very gratefully received. The shower is hot and good and Petra provided really nice towels for us all.

There are two restaurants right there by the apartment but we loved to just sit on the balcony and watch the water.

We enjoyed the space and design of the building, and Petra has great taste in furniture and artwork, we really fell in love with the whole place. It was very difficult to leave, we felt so relaxed here.
With or without children, Petra can offer a wonderful place to have a holiday combined with all the fun of the city a short and very pleasant journey away. Can we come back now? :)"
13340939;110088283;2016-10-24;62068616;Berit;Thank you Jasmijn for your beautiful apartment. We enjoyed staying there so much!! We really appreciated that you gave us the key as soon as possible. Furthermore the apartment was clean and quite close to the city centre. We would defenitly book it again if we come back to Amsterdam. Jasmijn, you made it so easy for us to feel like we're home.
4869412;58583311;2016-01-03;49167251;Olivier;Super weekend sur Amsterdam! L'appartement est très agréable, moderne et chaleureux. Victor a été très arrangeant également.
15710419;115637305;2016-11-26;29347952;Jim;Nice cosy (small) house in amsterdam north. Residential area. Perfect location for trips to and around amsterdam. Easy and free car parking, easy access to the highway  and also close to center of amsterdam. ( by taxi eur 10 to 15). Host is helpful and friendly, like his 2 cats which keep you company.  Recommended.
15850224;114408334;2016-11-18;103249822;Kris;Location is close to tram station so reaching the main attractions were convenient. We were welcomed by host's friend who was very nice. Thank you.
15850224;126609507;2017-01-13;48786575;Deni;Conor was a great host and was very helpful with questions we had about the city. The place is spacious and even though it's not in the city centre there is a direct tram connection to the Centraal Station. Would recommend!!
11517043;73272960;2016-05-07;62787002;Maximilian;Great apartment just as described in the pictures and info. It was clean and located ideally to explore Amsterdam. Igor was a great host, very uncomplicated and gave us plenty of tips. Communicating for check in and check out was very easy and gave us flexibility for arrival and departure. Overall a great experience that I can only recommend!
11517043;77076140;2016-05-30;7243090;Jerrell;I absolutely loved this flat, it looks even better than the pictures!  The main living room /kitchen is spacious and sunny.  There is a large comfy sofa to relax on, but even better, the large balcony is a great place to relax in the sun.  The bedroom is also spacious, and the bed comfy. The location, the de pijp neighborhood is very central.  There are restaurants and cafes in walking distance, and the tram is very close for farther journeys.  As other reviews have mentioned, there are steep steps to get into the flat, with no lift, so do keep that in mind (wasn't a problem at all for me, but I can see it being an issue for some). Iggy was great with the whole check in process, and his lovely wife met me to check out, very seamless.  I would definitely stay here again!
11517043;102786058;2016-09-19;14298401;Alex;Great experience at Iggy's apartment. A friendly host that obviously takes a lot of pride in what he does. The apartment was clean and tidy on arrival. Great location. Amenities were very good. A little noisy on the weekend but nothing too bad. Would definitely recommend Iggy's place to anyone else looking to stay in Amsterdam!

The neighbourhood is very quiet.
We were very welcomed by Yvonne.
We hope to rent this house again."
12320981;83728171;2016-07-04;37150152;Sonja;Karel's apartment was so charming! The four of us were very comfortable staying here, the childrens' bedrooms were great as was the loft upstairs. Close to major transportation routes and away from the hustle and bustle. The space was clean, bright, homey, and we were met by lovely people to exchange keys and give us a quick tour. All in all, a great place I'd highly recommend!
12320981;88879691;2016-07-25;67785904;Alex;"We had a very nice stay in Amsterdam. The Flat was clean and comfortable. Karel was a very nice host and his friends cares good about the check-in.

3920205;35609691;2015-06-20;23956274;Drew;"Everything about my stay was absolutely perfect. I can not commend Duco enough. 

I felt extremely welcome by Duco and the introduction and tour was extremely professional and polite. Duco made himself available if I needed anything which was very comforting.

The apartment was just beautiful, exactly as pictured, if not even more beautiful. It was so lovely I didn't want to leave. Beautifully decorated. Comfy bedroom, new bathroom and kitchen and a really lovely balcony. 

Great central heating system if you are a sucker for warm weather like myself.

Also I loved the area! Great restaurants, shopping, markets all within walking distance and grocery store across the road. 

All in all I was beyond happy with my stay! My favourite stay was here (I travelled Europe for 4 weeks).

Thank you for having Jack and I."

4531609;29973273;2015-04-15;24638531;Angelo;I don't have much experience with airbnb yet but this has been my best so far. Iva was extremely helpful regarding everything I needed. She sent me personalized info for the things I was interested in and was always available via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) to answer any questions I had. The place is in immaculate condition and even included some food and beverages to welcome me. You can't go wrong staying here, highly recommended.

She took great care in orienting my husband and I about her place (which included a bottle of merlot, fruit basket, cheese, eggs, milk, juice, bread, cereal, cookies etc), gave great advice about restaurants and things to do in Amsterdam, and quickly responded to any questions we had. The room was exactly as described and pictured, and very clean. We felt extremely comfortable and relieved as this was our first Airbnb experience! Thanks Iva for taking such good care!"
4531609;38844674;2015-07-19;33556270;Tom;"Iva made us feel very welcome at her lovely studio apartment, in a great location; safe, residential and peaceful with good tram links that get you to the centre of town in ten minutes. The studio itself was beautiful, equipped with everything we needed for our short stay. The bathroom was fantastic and the bed was incredible (beware: you may be at risk of missing out on seeing the sights of Amsterdam due to not being able to get out of bed, yes, it's that comfy). Throughout our stay, Iva was very helpful and approachable, providing us with restaurant recommendations, tram/train info and general advice. Overall a lovely place to stay, which we thoroughly recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
4531609;41929092;2015-08-10;31236339;Gregory;Iva was a really great host. The room was clean and immaculate all-round and we were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived (also, the bed is the most comfortable we've ever slept in). Iva shared really helpful insight on places to eat and things like grocery stores and transport. The area that the studio is situated in is ideal – so close to multiple tram stops and it gives you a great sense of what life in Amsterdam seems to be like. We would recommend the studio to anyone visiting this amazing city. Thanks, Iva!

The studio perfectly fits the description and is located a few steps from the tram stop which leads to Amsterdam center in 10 minutes.
The bottle of wine, fruits, and other little things have made our stay more enjoyable. No doubt we will come back back for our next travel to Amsterdam. Thanks Iva !"
4531609;52318326;2015-10-28;26461059;Mark;"She was beyond amazing, she greeted us way earlier than we should have been there, she was very gracious, details in every corner of the room, I can't say enough about Iva and our experience at her home.

It's close to every tram in and out of the city center, the neighborhood is beautiful, the bed was so comfortable and she even had stroowafless and wine for us! We will return to her elegant and so cozy studio next time we visit Amsterdam!!!!"

He was very helpful in showing me details about the area like local restaurants, shopping, sights and events happening this weekend.  He was polite and offered any beverages already in the refrigerator.  He also was helpful during my stay via texted on any questions I had during my stay.  The Apartment was lovely. It was a wonderful place.  I really had a great time and experience in Amsterdam and I attribute it to being in the middle of the city where things happen and not located in a hotel at one end of the city.  I highly recommend Ankie's Apartment!

Flat isn't so big, but really comfortable and clean. Unfortunately we haven't met Olga but her friend Sara was really friendly and helped us with all questions we had.

Das Bad ist ein wenig eng und die Toilettentür mag nicht so gern schließen, aber die Räume sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und genauso schön wie auf den Fotos. Das eigentliche Zimmer ist ziemlich groß, das Bett bequem und morgens wird man von den Vögeln aus dem Hinterhof geweckt. Morgens konnten wir im Wohnzimmer oft bei Sonnenschein frühstücken und abends haben wir auch mal in der Küche gekocht. Mit Induktionsherd, stilvollem Geschirr und Spülmaschine hat das wirklich Spaß gemacht. Da Inga viel unterwegs ist, hatten wir manchmal das Gefühl eine eigene Wohnung für uns allein zu haben :) 
In der Strasse gibt es zwei Bäckereien, tolle Cafes und die S-Bahn ist auch nicht weit. Wenn wir nochmals nach Berlin kommen, würden wir uns freuen, wieder hier wohnen zu dürfen. Danke Inga!"
2047139;84070060;2016-07-05;10307817;Stephen;Great host and location! Had a really wonderful time in Berlin and would definitely rcommend!
2047139;86165915;2016-07-15;19294443;Melissa;Inga was a great host, it was very comfortable and easy to share a space with them!!
2047139;106478089;2016-10-06;72324461;Jonathan;Loved staying with Inga. Very nice place and near the subway station. Lots of bakeries and places nearby
2047139;123411511;2016-12-29;26004942;Carolien;Der Berliner Altbau Charme ist ideal um Berlin mittendrin kennenzulernen. Gute Anbindung an die Innenstadt. Angenehme Wohnlage, aber obendrüber wohnt eine Familie mit Kindern, die ab und zu mal laut waren. Die Kommunikation mit Inga war einfach und unkompliziert, genauso wie Check in und Check out. Die Wohnung ist ein Mix aus vintage und spartanisch, was durchaus seinen Zweck erfüllte!  Danke Inga.
2047139;126925562;2017-01-15;106124566;Susann;"Mein Aufenthalt bei Inga war wirklich sehr angenehm! Man kann hier in Ruhe ausspannen und auf Erkundungstour gehen (in der Nähe gibt es einige sehr tolle Cafés). Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und zudem geschmackvoll eingerichtet, das Zimmer war sehr groß und hat alles, was man braucht. Ganz toll fand ich das Bett, weil es wirklich sehr groß und bequem war. Die Lage zum Hinterhof war perfekt, hier hat Straßenlärm keine Chance.
Leider war die Familie ein Stockwerk höher teilweise sehr laut, dafür kann aber die charmante Gastgeberin natürlich nichts! Es tut dem Ganzen auch keinen Abbruch ;) 
Das Internet hätte allerdings etwas besser sein können, ich hatte nur akzeptablen Empfang, wenn ich alleine in der Wohnung war.
Inga hat sich bei allem große Mühe gegeben und ich durfte alles mit benutzen, sogar Wäsche waschen und ein Paket empfangen!

Vielen Dank für dein entgegen gebrachtes Vertrauen, liebe Inga!! :) ich komme gerne wieder!"
2047139;131672605;2017-02-13;3988443;Dorothea;Unser Aufenthalt bei Inga war sehr unkompliziert. Für alle Probleme hatte sie eine schnelle Lösung parat. Kurzfristig konnte ich Mann und Baby zubuchen - Inga legte einfach noch eine Matratze dazu. In der ersten Nacht war uns total kalt - Inga organisierte einfach eine weitere Decke. Danke dafür! Zwar war die telefonische Kommunikation zwischendurch etwas schwierig, aber per Mail sind wir immer gut zusammen gekommen. Also alles in allem eine empfehlenswerte Gastgeberin!
6635677;34259143;2015-06-06;30932609;Tess;Great little apartment! Our host left us cute little notes all over the house with instructions and suggestions. She even had a bottle of wine and some candy waiting for us. Very sweet!
6635677;38934822;2015-07-19;25085616;Ingeborg;"We highly recommend staying at Sarah's apartment if you are going to Berlin.

The apartment is centrally placed in Friedrichshain. The urban neighbourhood - and the apartment's relaxing, cosy and cool atmosphere - is a perfect starting point for enjoying and exploring the city. Coffee in the morning on Sarah's amazing rooftop veranda definitely made our days! 

We did not have the pleasure of meeting Sarah, but her informative and helpful little notes in the apartment made us feel warmly welcomed."
6635677;41026389;2015-08-03;5536742;Teiji;It was good to stay. But I could not get back from Sarah for getting the key. She was not good to my email back. And it's 5th floors without lift. So if you have big bag of stuff. It's quite hard to carry up. And no sink in the kitchen. So we have to use the water from bathroom for drinking water or washing up dishes.  I am happy rest of the things
6635677;41888156;2015-08-09;9280622;Adis;Der Kontakt war unkompliziert und Sarah sehr freundlich. leider konnten wir die Reise nicht antreten. Ich hoffe nächstes Mal klappts...
6635677;46811879;2015-09-13;29393566;Laura Gundorff;"Sarahs apartment is not only bigger, but also more cosy than you think by looking at the pictures. The apartment has a nice, bohemian and relaxed atmosphere and a nice balcony, which is very nice, if the weather is good.

It is located near an U-Bahn-station, and it is within walking distance from a lot of restaurants and cafes. There are also a couple of nice cafes in the same street as the apartment.

The apartment was nice and clean, and Sarah had bought us a couple of treats and water :-) And in generel Sarah is really, really nice and helpful and open :-)"
6635677;103711566;2016-09-23;90823629;Claire;Sarah made our first air BnB experience a delight! Before leaving the UK, we arranged hand over of the keys which went to plan and had the chance to meet Sarah who was lovely and welcoming. The apartment is a stone throw away from the subway making travel into the centre a ten minute journey. With the s9 train from the airport being a five minute walk from the apartment also. The apartment is spacious and quirky with the roof terrace as an added bonus. Supermarket around the corner. Would highly recommend staying here and will be passing Sarah's details onto friends. Thanks again Sarah! Claire and Robbie :-)
268974;25209690;2015-01-09;17616394;Vladislav;"Прекрасное место!
Очень жалеем, что остановились тут только на две ночи. За тот день, что мы провели в этом доме, мы отогрелись и прекрасно отдохнули. В квартире есть всё.
Обязательно остановимся здесь ещё раз.

Amazing apartment!
Pity our stay was so short. Having driven over 1000 km through snowstorm and -10°C, it was such joy to come to this oasis of warmth and comfort.
Very good and well equipped kitchen.
We will definitely stay here again one day."
499342;2814484;2012-11-05;3922187;Marion;Karsten is a very friendly and kind host. It was no problem at all that we checked in quite late. The Apartment is exactly as described and we enjoyed our stay there. It was easy for us to explore Berlin from there. Overall everything was to our utter satisfaction.
499342;2929737;2012-11-20;3535247;Rachel;My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Karsten's apartment, he was very helpful all the way through the booking and meeting us at the apartment when we arrived. The room was large and very clean, the shower was one of the best we'd had after 3 months of travelling! There is a tram which runs around every 20 minutes which is quite loud, but not loud enough to wake us once we were asleep. However, this means there is transport straight into town right outside the door!
499342;11560567;2014-04-07;9680980;Irene;Freundlich und charmant hat uns Karsten empfangen. Es war das erste Mal, dass wir eine Wohnung über airbnb gebucht haben. Schnell ist man von der nahen U-Bahnstation in der Stadtmitte. Wir spürten in der Wohnung Karstens Liebe zum  Detail. Wir haben uns wohl gefühlt und kommen gerne wieder.
499342;23800586;2014-12-10;24361400;Gabrielle;"Karsten était à l'heure au rendez vous, il est charmant et très attentionné
nous avions communiqué avant notre arrivée pour des renseignements pratiques  Il a très gentillement répondu  malgré mon allemand approximatif"

Des chocolats et une bouteille nous attendaient pour cette période des fêtes, ce que nous avons bien appécié et trouvé que c était une délicate attention !."
499342;30935726;2015-04-29;29282693;Gary;"Me and my boyfriend visited Berlin for 5 nights and Karstens apartment was the best choice for us! He was so helpful and patient when we were booking and really flexible with our check in time! It was so easy to find and Karsten gave us a detailed description of how to get there. Once we arrived he was welcoming and took the time to recommend some great places to eat and drink. The apartment is close to the underground so it's really easy to get anywhere in the city without being in a noisy and busy street! The apartment itself is lovely and spacious and very modern; and so reasonable compared to many similar places in Berlin! 
We had a wonderful time and couldn't recommend it enough! 
Even if the places you're looking to visit aren't that close, Karstens apartment  is a great place to stay in Berlin!"
499342;33370750;2015-05-27;19877680;Cillia;We had a lovely stay in Berlin. The place was clean and located just next to the U-bahn which made it really convenient for us. Karsten gave us really good directions and we got to his place with no fuss at all. The host was friendly and sat us down and gave us some tips on places to visit in Berlin. Definitely a good choice of place to stay!
499342;59507934;2016-01-11;11019910;Anton;Very good located in a nice and comfort district Mitte. Just close to Berlin Wall Memorial. Underground is behind the corner.  Simple but interesting designed apartment's space. Has everything to feel comfortably in modern life. Definitely recommended for couples!)
499342;61204910;2016-02-01;4900368;Jacqueline;Karsten met me at the apartment in person, after being super responsive on the Airbnb app. The room was beautifully designed, very conveniently located for the subway. With that said, this room is for Airbnb-ers who do not need to do laundry. I would highly recommend this host and place
499342;62700005;2016-02-16;29976959;Conchúr;This is a beautiful apartment situated two minutes away from the subway. Karsten was a great host and he made us feel very welcome! I'd recommend this accommodation highly.
499342;64243322;2016-03-01;2210500;Ianthe;Karstens place was perfectly located, just a 5 mins walk to the metro station.  The apartment is actually more spacious than how it looked in the photos and was fully equipped with what you need.  Karsten waited for us at the apartment on our first day and spent sometime telling us what to do and go during our stay! it was perfect, thanks Karsten!
499342;69691312;2016-04-12;42674107;Alexandra;"We had a really really wonderful time staying in Karsten's apartment. Lovely interior, high ceilings to make it feel spacious even though it's small. Very powerful shower! 

Absolutely fantastic location - in a quiet pretty street but so close to public transport. U-Bahn is at the end of the road (1-2 minute walk) and a few stops will take you right into the centre. Also only a 5-10 minute walk to the Berlin Wall Memorial.

Karsten was a really helpful host, let us check in and out whenever we wanted.

I'd highly recommend this place!!"
499342;89563206;2016-07-29;54097723;Norman;Karsten was an excellent host. He answered messages promptly and met us on arrival even though we arrived late. The apartment is equipped with the basics and works well for a short stay. Its is very close to the metro, shops and a good bar. We had great stay and recommended it.
499342;100537680;2016-09-09;93192862;James;The apartment was a great place to stay with lots of character, clean and well supplied. Karsten got in touch as soon as we booked with clear details about how to find it, and when we arrived he spent time giving us lots of good local recommendations. Highly recommended!
499342;111665294;2016-11-01;7693861;Nelly;Quartier calme, proche de beaucoup de centres d'intérêt berlinois, une partie du mur, l'île aux musée, etc...l'appartement est situé à 1 min du métro.
499342;138882410;2017-03-22;5058501;Beth;This is a great modern apartment in Berlin. Close to transit and a lot sites. Karsten was great and responsive. We stayed for 4 days as tourists and really enjoyed the space. I would higly recommend it.
499342;145151201;2017-04-17;22977214;Caitlin;Karsten's flat is fantastic, right around the corner from shops, groceries, and restaurants, and a tube station. The flat is bright, comfortable and clean, we really enjoyed it. Kartsten was a great host, everything was really easy!
5784956;30349799;2015-04-20;3781827;Mikkel;The flat is located just next to Gneissenausstr on the U7-line and few steps away from Bergmannkiez with loads of bars, coffee places and restaurants. A true Berlin gem! The place is well-equipped although a minus that there is no wi fi. But I would totally stay there again. Lena is very communicative!
5784956;35472704;2015-06-19;26145692;Sarah;The apartment was great and Lena was lovely. It was really easy to get to via public transport and was in a great neighborhood with a bunch of food and shopping options. We hired bikes from a nearby hostel and found it really easy to explore neighboring suburbs by public transport and bike riding. The apartment is super clean and very comfortable. We loved it and had a great time in Berlin.
5784956;59386395;2016-01-10;5239736;Valérie;"Lena is a great host. She is welcomed and she gave us some tips to enjoy the city. 
The appartment is at 5min by walk from the subway station (if you walk slowly). Clean, warm, perfect !
We really enjoyed our stay !"
5784956;107927469;2016-10-13;98039708;Stephanie;"We loved staying at Lena's! The flat is well located, 2 minutes away from the Tube. The neighbourhood is great and offers tons of options to chill in the evening! 

The purpose of our trip was business but I've visited Berlin before and I think it's also a nice place to stay at if you wanna discover the city! 

Many Thanks Lena!"
5784956;108659548;2016-10-16;6325388;Asis;Mooie en efficiënte ruimte in het gezellige Kreuzberg. Lena is een goede gastheer.

We highly recommend Lena as a host."
5784956;114052049;2016-11-15;6739711;Stuart;"Excellent apartment in a really nice location. We visited most of the city by foot, including all the way up to Mitte and the other side Kruezberg, although we do like walking. The local area was also excellent, Bergmann had a load of decent options for breakfast and dinner, including a vegan supermarket and a vegetarian butcher! 

Lena was away when we stayed, so we didn't meet her, but we were met by her friend, who was really helpful.

This place is really convenient for the airport, too. Takes about 30-40 minutes.

Amenities in the apartment were excellent. The temperature was around freezing the whole time we were in Berlin, and getting back to this cosy place was perfect. Underfloor heating keeps you snug.

A nice touch was a carton of milk in the fridge, some bread and tomatoes as well as a whole host of stuff like olive oil, coffee, tea, washing up liquid.

Excellent wifi. Great kitchen. Comfy bed. Super quiet. A really nice place to stay."
5784956;128384211;2017-01-24;6916826;Manue;Lena ist eine freundliche und flexible Gastgeberin. Die Wohnung ist groß, geschmackvoll eingerichtet und sehr gemütlich, es gibt sogar einen Kamin!

Ich würde jederzeit die Wohnung wieder mieten. Danke Lena!
5784956;144593069;2017-04-16;14967987;Linh;Lena was a nice host, good communication upon arrival and during our stay. Location is very good, near subway, lots if good (coffee) bars, restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood.

5588646;52446634;2015-10-29;46921055;Sarah;Fi is a great and welcoming host. He checked in a few times to make sure all was ok. I was a solo traveller with a small dog and he even provided a dog blanket for her. The cool, artsy, eclectic studio was a nice size for just the two of us, though the bathroom was a little small. Also, the bed was a little too hard for my preference and I couldn't get comfortable at night. The location was in a quiet neighbourhood but really near a beautiful park which was great for my dog. As I had a car, there was free parking next to the park so that worked out well for my 1-week stay! There's also a Thai massage place two doors down from Fi's studio and I would absolutely recommend that! I only visited on my last day but wish I had gone more often.
2104377;40657088;2015-08-01;14167209;Ditte Marie;"The host Janina was very nice and even made me a cup of coffee one of the days to get to know me better, so you did not have feel like someone who was just living there as a stranger.
The location and Kreutzberg was a super good area to live in."

The apartment was clean, modern, well-equipped, and just as described on the website. The neighborhood felt very safe and was close by to public transportation, so it was very easy to get into the city. Mike and Rene even left us some food and drinks in the fridge as well as plenty of towels, blankets, etc. They were so friendly and accommodating, and I would definitely recommend staying with them if you're looking for a nice quiet place near Berlin!

15031615;106305387;2016-10-05;6594343;Josh & Ayelet;Very cool little studio apartment! Julian has styled the place very nicely with cool furniture. Place was perfectly clean and had everything we needed for our week long visit in Berlin. Area isn't exactly central...quite far from the city centre and is a bit of a walk to get to shops, cafes etc. best way to deal with this situation is to hire bikes to get around. The apartment block is on a main road so there also was a bit of noise traffic at night. However Julian was very responsive and helpful host :)
15031615;129104732;2017-01-29;12401;Tanya;Just moved to Berlin from NYC so was looking for a place I could stay for a couple weeks while I looked for more permanent accommodations and Julian's place was perfect for this. With two U-Bahn stops/lines within short walking distance, it was easy to get around. Plus I loved that the apartment had some kitchen essentials so I was able to buy groceries and cook some meals. Well-priced for the area, elevator, good light, clean, comfy, central location, very responsive if needed, all-in-all great stay. Thanks Julian!

The apartment is in a very beautiful neighbourhood of berlin.."
869793;38271753;2015-07-14;25021217;Georgie & Imogen;Very nice apartment in great location with cute bar downstairs. Spacious and well equipped. Easy check in and very clean.

869793;47035265;2015-09-15;3272123;Sophie;We had an easy and comfortable stay with Kristen. We couldn't have asked for more a great apartment with all we needed for the baby including a cot and high chair which made eating together much more fun! The apartment is in a great location close enough to a ubahn station and the market hall and bar downstairs were great. Lots going on and too much to explore in our short trip we'll be back. Thank you very much Kristen.
869793;49190683;2015-10-01;27434721;Autumn;This flat was nicely decorated and spacious in a convenient neighbourhood. There is lots to do and transportation nearby. I only needed a place to sleep for one night, but this would be a great spot for a longer stay. The bar downstairs was super busy and it was fun to sit outside on the balcony and listen to the excitement.
869793;52845980;2015-11-02;467199;Busi;"Kirsten’s apartment in the heart of Kreuzberg is beautiful. We had a wonderful time staying here and we got to have the place to ourselves.
It is in an exquisite old apartment block and was very tidy. We had everything we needed from tea to extra blankets and Kirsten was very helpful and kind."
869793;65178026;2016-03-11;15205640;Yogev;The experience at Kirsten's appartment was perfect. The apartment is beautiful, clean and in a very nice quiet area. Everything was ready for us when we arrived, and the communication was very good. I recommend!
869793;98434606;2016-08-31;13553891;Fleur;Beautiful apartment in great location. Highly recommended.
4885745;70285707;2016-04-17;803979;Stephanie;"We had a great time at Ilonas apartment! The location in De Pijp is great - there are some really cool bars, restaurants and the street market close by. It's well connected by public transport, but we actually chose to walk most of the time. The only problem was that the apartment was hard to find in the beginning because there was some miscommunication regarding the address - but if you have the correct address, it will be easy to find and you will enjoy your stay there! :) Also, the bed is very, very, very comfortable! ;)"
4885745;100879183;2016-09-11;4322785;Brian;Ilona was extremely accommodating and met me personally at the apartment for an early check in. The flat is located a short walk from Sarphatipark and is surrounded by quaint cafes and restaurants. The place was cozy yet spacious and has amazing rooftop views of De Pijp. I would definitely recommend staying at Ilona's flat next time you visit Amsterdam!
4885745;125146419;2017-01-04;104481108;Rotem;Ilona's place looks like a showroom in a cool furniture  store, the house is clean and well organized great location is kind of close to everything. And ilona is a great host! We had a lot of fun mostly   Because of the apartment.

Everything look like the pictures
Nina is very nice and friendly and easy to comminicate with"
15853011;120589225;2016-12-11;24137529;Marie-Michele;"The Host was so good with Communication 

They always replied immediately and kindly"
5777334;34664822;2015-06-10;2006028;Jessica;"Klaske's loft is absolutely fantastic. The location can not be beat and the flat itself is absolutely delightful. 

Klaske as a host is very warm and welcoming. She had left me a few Dutch treats which was very sweet of her :-). Nespresso machine in the loft was also much appreciated.

She has quite a design eye so the loft has been decorated in a beatiful way, including a new bathroom.

Bed was so comfortable, I had the best sleeps.

If you want to really feel like a local and stay in the 9 streets, this is the place to do it.

I can't wait to come back!"
5777334;50532987;2015-10-12;3944085;Rafal;"We spent 2 nights at Klaske's place and loved it! 

She was a very friendly and thoughtful host. Leaving the light on for us so we don't come ""home"" in complete darkness, or a nice complimentary bottle of wine - all the little things that made this stay special.

The room was spacious and very clean, the bathroom airy and supplied with everything that you might need. It's in the centre of Amsterdam so most of the attractions are easily reachable on foot - another perk of staying there.

Highly recommended."
5777334;50879372;2015-10-15;31740243;Tong;Klaske 's house is awesome,well decorated and good location,the klaske is very helpful and with a very lovely cat ,truly recommended
5777334;51698337;2015-10-24;7475623;Clemens;My parents had a wonderful stay at your perfectly located and very cosy appartement. Thank you very much!
5777334;66149479;2016-03-20;47484482;Delphine;Merci pour ce merveilleux moment passé chez Klaske, superbe chambre tellement cosy ... merci pour votre gentillesse et pour avoir pris le temps de nous renseigner ..
5777334;84730839;2016-07-08;12698701;Eric;What a fantastic place to stay when visiting Amsterdam! Klaske made us feel welcome even before we arrived with fantastic communication skills. Even though we arrived early we found our room ready and waiting - and what a room it is! The space is only comparable to something from an editorial in a 'World of Interiors' publication. The bed is ridiculously comfortable and the rainfall shower is a dream. Furthermore, Klaske's home is located extremely centrally within Amsterdam, right in the middle of the 9 streets. Here you can find plenty of places to eat, drink, relax, shop and watch the world go by. If you are struggling to decide what to do Klaske will be more than happy to offer up some amazing suggestions or point you to the many guide books she has to offer. We found the '500 best kept secrets of Amsterdam' book especially insightful and used it to find the city's botanical gardens, which were amazing! I would have no problem in recommending this fantastic AirBnB to anybody and will definitely try and stay with Klaske again should I take another trip to this inspirational city!
5777334;87027006;2016-07-18;45892063;Dries;Heel mooie kamer.  Uitstekend ontvangst.
5777334;89622887;2016-07-29;22383115;Corey;The location was perfect! We were right in the middle of Amsterdam and could walk anywhere within 20-30 minutes. The place was beautiful as well and looks just like the pictures posted online. Finally, Klaske gave us some great recommendations and was great to chat with at the end of the day about our adventures. She even called a cab for us to get to the airport at the end of our trip.
5777334;93139900;2016-08-11;187869;Sarah;We loved staying at Klaske's beautiful home! The location can't be beat, on a picturesque street lined with shops and restaurants and walking distance to everything we had on our list. Klaske provided us with guidebooks and personal recommendations, as well as coffee and treats. The apartment is just as it appears in photos and we hope to be back.
5777334;103760141;2016-09-24;37818414;Christoph;Klaske's house was well located in a beautiful neighbourhood. Ideal for walks and close to all kinds of good restaurants and bars. We loved all the little details of the room's nicely furnitured interior and especially enjoyed her warm hospitality.
5777334;122112474;2016-12-21;19393103;Matteo;Great location, the nine streets are beautiful!
5777334;123708950;2016-12-30;22042816;Sylvain;We stayed at Klaske's place for 3 days this winter and had a wonderful time. The apartment is so charming and neat. The location is absolutely perfect, right in the middle of the most beautiful part of the city. Klaske was a great host as well. Thank you so much

Il est situé dans un super quartier, tout proche du Jordaan à pied, proche du tram et pas très loin de Leidsplein. Il y a une vue sympa sur un canal et le quartier est calme. On peut faire beaucoup de choses à pied depuis l'appartement, ce qui rend les balades agréables!
Nous n'avons pas rencontré notre hôte, mais il n'y a pas eu de problème pour récupérer les clés ni pour les rendre."

Het appartement voldeed volledig aan de verwachtingen: licht, modern, schoon en vooral warm en gezellig, compleet met kerstboom. 
De ligging is ideaal, dichtbij de Jordaan, het centrum en met openbaar vervoer om de hoek. 
Een aanrader, wij komen hier graag nog eens terug!"
12757804;125907123;2017-01-08;21142457;Des;Elspeth was a very organised and friendly host.  The arrival was handled efficiently by the 'butler' service and they even called back later that evening to drop off a second set of keys.  The house is very comfortable, well appointed and very homely.  The location is very good as there are several tram and bus stops nearby to connect with city centre, museums etc.  We arrived by car and made use of the P&R facility which, if you follow the instructions, cost only 1 euro per day for parking.  Thanks to Elspeth and her family for such a comfortable and happy stay.
685990;4381866;2013-05-01;5818021;Anna&Lucas;Nadia was a very nice host: reliable and friendly. She has a very nice apartment too, clean and well connected to the city center. I would defenetly recommend her!

i would highly recommend staying with nadia....!!!"
685990;7437394;2013-09-20;7640085;Agustini;I have great time during my stay in Amsterdam. The location is near to train station and not far from Shipol Airport.  The place is nice and comfortable. The host is nice and friendly. This place is highly recommended

The house is extremely clean,comfortable and nice (and very quiet!!!)
They are always ready to help you in everything(,really),You will choose the best for you if you are going there.
One more thing,the beds are great:,the kitchen is full equipped for your requirements,in your time in this beatifull city.You have buses to get everywere and very close to the house the train station that takes you to many different places and the airport."
685990;13217752;2014-05-22;2433850;Erica;Nadia and Naomi were both lovely, not to mention incredibly helpful when I needed help getting to places and dealing with my lost luggage!  The room was simple but it had everything I needed during my stay and was just far enough away from the center that it was a peaceful place to come back to after a day in the city.  I highly recommend staying with them!
685990;14756437;2014-06-25;16215400;James;The hosts were very lovely people. The place itself was clean, easy to get to from the city center (one stop and a quick walk) and a nice, quiet place to get some rest from the busy, noisy days.
685990;17043285;2014-08-06;6442335;Tim;"Nadia made me feel incredibly welcome from the moment I stepped inside her *gorgeous* place. Actually I felt welcome even BEFORE I went inside; she has an incredible garden in front that makes for the cutest, most colorful entry.

She had some Dutch sweets for me, and her guest room has plenty of shelves and closet space, which can be rare with Airbnb. And it's a really quiet location, close to a major train station where you can on nearly any train line, and you're at Amsterdam Centraal in only one stop! It's very convenient to all the crazy fun in Amsterdam, but yet you feel like you're a peaceful world away at Nadia's lovely home.

It was also really fun talking to Nadia; I wish we could have talked longer. We probably could have solved all the world's problems together! :)

Oh--and Amsterdam is the BEST!"
685990;22551953;2014-11-09;22745920;Annemarie;"Nadia and her daughter are very kind persons. Easy to communicate with. 
The guest space in Nadia s room is not only the guest room. It is an independent guest space with room-kitchen-bathroom.
Very pleasant to live.
One great advantage for me was the direct bus connection with Amsterdam city center And Amsterdam Airport. No stress, no hassle.
It was my first experience with AirBnB.
 Thank You Nadia, you are a great AirBnB ambassadress  :-)"
685990;24643090;2015-01-01;18006123;Bernadette;Everything was fine, Nadia is really friendly, thank you!
685990;37450423;2015-07-07;1579994;Moti;"The hosting in Nadia's room was perfect. The room is located in quiet neighborhood - Sloterdijk and of course near by station Sloterdijk from that we took everyday bus to the center Amsterdam or train to other parts of Holland.
It was lovely vacation for us, visited museums, did canal cruise, visited in fisherman villages and Madurodam (by den Haag) and all this by efficient public transportation from the near Sloterdijk Station (trains, buses, trams). 
We definitely recommend Nadia's room   :-)"
685990;43220897;2015-08-18;28830972;Beth;We stayed with Nadia for 5 nights and had a fantastic experience. Her place is about a 7 minute walk to One of the central train stations in Amsterdam which is great as we were able to catch all our trains/trams/buses into the centre, and also straight from the airport. The room was very clean and had comfortable beds, and we felt like we had a lot of privacy as we had our own private kitchen and bathroom on the top floor. The kitchen was well stocked as they had provided tea and snacks for breakfast, all the necessities! Nadia and her daughter were super friendly and were able to answer any questions we had about the place. Would highly recommend this if you're looking to stay somewhere affordable in Amsterdam!
685990;54213113;2015-11-16;39294431;Linh;Nadia made my stay as comfortable and as pleasant as possible. The room, kitchen and bathroom were just as described. The location is in the middle of two tram/train/metro stops which made it very easy to access everywhere else. You can be in the city in 15 minutes. Nadia was very helpful in terms of her knowledge of the city and its history, so pick her brain! I enjoyed the stay and our conversations. I would most certainly recommend Nadia's place!
685990;57055497;2015-12-21;49780922;David;We had a delightful three day stay. Nadia knows the sights to see. She called to make sure a restaurant was open and made a reservation for us. She gave a terrific recommendation to see a set of windmills and a museum to the north. BTW, the room was clean and comfortable. I'd go back in a New York minute!
685990;62778159;2016-02-16;163601;Aurélie;Nadia and her daughter are great hosts! Both gave us a warm welcome and made us feel like home. Nadia gave us some good advices for transportation or nice places to visit and was available for us when we had questions. The place was very nice too and quiet, located very close from Sloterdijk Station where there are many buses, trams & metros taking you to any part of the city. The room was comfortable and clean with a big wardrobe. On the same floor we also had access to a cute kitchen that we shared with 2 other guests and where we could have  breakfast or cook a little something. The bathroom was nice as well and had a big shower and  a *oh so nice* subfloor heating  :)) We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely come again! Thank you so much Nadia & Naomi for having contributed to make our stay in your beautiful city such a nice experience and memory! Lots of Love! xoxoxo
685990;82991468;2016-06-30;66199351;Cristian;"Excelente lugar, muy limpio todo, todo nuevo,  Nadia muy buena anfitriona,  Nos fue a buscar a la estación de subte,  muy amigable,  totalmente recomiendo el lugar y volvería. 
Gracias Nadia  por todo."
685990;87392032;2016-07-19;78978660;Sonja;Nadia was a very friendly host and gave us directions and suggestions of where to go in the area. The room, kitchen, and bathrooms were clean and provided everything we needed. There was some type of construction nearby so it was a bit noisy at times, since we had the window open. Overall we enjoyed our stay with Nadia and are grateful for her hospitality.
685990;121663451;2016-12-18;31672584;Daryl;Nadia was an excellent host. She and her daughter were more than helpful when it came to questions about the city, & were very friendly & welcoming. She was quick & efficient to answer back whenever I messaged her. My friend and I shared the double bed room & had the entire top floor to ourselves including a bathroom and kitchen that was well equipped with anything we needed and was only a 5 min bike ride from the supermarket, when we wanted to pick up food. Her place is only a 5-10 min walk from transit that is less than half an hour away from the center & a 15-20 minute bike ride from the center & many other popular attractions. She helped make our first visit to amsterdam a  smooth trip. I would definitely recommend.
488971;13096730;2014-05-19;642930;Ryan;Beautiful apartment, very clean and organized. Great view of a canal and near groceries. Smooth check in.

5081851;29096080;2015-04-04;5195874;Silke & Martin;Meinen Töchtern und mir hat es bei Irene und Finist sehr gut gefallen. Finists Mutter Monique hatte mit dem Wohnungsschlüssel auf uns gewartet und uns  kurz das Wichtigste zur Wohnung erklärt.  Die Wohnung war genauso freundlich, hell und gemütlich wie beschrieben. Bos en Lommer ist ein bunter Stadtteil, mit viel Grün in der Nähe (Erasmuspark und Westerpark). Mit der 14er Straßenbahn und dem Stadtbus 21 (Haltestelle 2min entfernt) kann man das Zentrum schnell und bequem erreichen.  Wir können die Wohnung jederzeit weiter empfehlen!!! Vielen Dank an Irene und Finist..... für Eure Tipps, Eure netten Mails und die Begrüßungsgetränke :)

Avons passé un excellent séjour entre amis."
11603060;93897651;2016-08-14;88007368;Heiko;Roy is a very nice and helpfull host. His Apartment is great, everything as discribed, and the view from the livingroom was beautiful. Thanks for this perfect tripp to Amsterdam.
11603060;111481340;2016-10-31;43244077;Bader;Great host , beautiful apartment and amazing view. Quite a walk to central station. But definitely would do it again
12994276;82551444;2016-06-28;41976800;Michèle;We Booked for 4 persons two nights in this two room flat. For us everything was enough and the place not  too far away City Center. We enjoyd.
12994276;86835253;2016-07-17;20406890;Matthieu;"We stay three nights. The flat is very nice and spacious. Furthermore, it is very close from Central Station and is located in a lovely and very quiet neighbourhood. Joran and his housemates are very nice. 

Nous sommes restez trois nuits dans cet appartement. Il est conforme aux photos. De plus, il est relativement proche de la gare centrale et se situe dans un quartier très résidentiel et calme. Joran et ses colocataires sont très accueillants."
12994276;89749677;2016-07-29;83974064;Jesse;Very nice place, enjoyed our stay. Walk into town was 15 minutes. Would stay again.
7304719;94248769;2016-08-15;20330338;Stéphane;"The three of us spent five nights at Philip's lovely lovely, and we were very pleased. The appartment is spacious, nicely furnished, homely, very clean and tidy and in a quiet, great location overlooking a canal just outside the city centre - 10 minutes walk from the historic Jordaan district, with its multitude of bars and restaurants, and within very easy reach of public transport (including the terminus of the airport bus). We had the use of the entire appartment, with a very large living room and main bedroom, a well-equipped kitchen (although we hardly used this, there is an ample supply of cooking utensils) and a pretty outside terrace with a view over the canal; the second bedroom is cozy, but a little small.  There is a shower room but no bath. Philip greeted us in person, and was most welcoming and helpful - and also available for any questions during our stay. The appartment is on the fourth storey of a modern block of flats, but there is no lift - so perhaps not suitable for guests with heavy luggage who have difficulties with stairs. We would certainly recommend the place for any group of 2-3 people who wish to discover the delights of Amsterdam."
6183845;43568564;2015-08-20;40434629;Edouard;"When we arrived day one, I knew it would feels like home!
The room is large and bright, the view is just great, we had great time just siting and watch the canal' life.. The location is perfect, cause quiet and beautiful, not so far from the center!
Thank you again Natacha! we spent memorable vacation in your wonderful house!"
6183845;78148300;2016-06-05;42429;Laila;"This is an awesome location to stay for visiting Amsterdam. It's a teensy bit outside the loud city center but within walking distance of everything (also easy location from the trams), best of both worlds that way. It's right on the Herengracht and there's even a bench right across the narrow street to sit outside and watch the canal boats and cyclists go by. The space is gloriously filled with light (she also provided black out curtains and privacy sheers which is helpful on those long summer days) and is lovingly decorated. We found amazing food in the area short walks away: Pluk Amsterdam (possibly the best hollandaise I've ever had), Bussia was lovely Italian haut cuisine,  and great Indonesian food.

We didn't get to meet our host, but the girls we met were helpful and easy to reach. There was a little problem with a basement leak causing the mini fridge outlet to go out, but it was very quickly resolved. The bed is super soft, we hoped for a little firmer, but that is really individual preference. The chairs and table look cute, but the chairs were too small for me to be able to sit in them (I am a large woman, admittedly). The kitchenette was a lovely addition. I was able to make tea and for us to have snacks or breakfast and there are grocery stores conveniently located so we were able to skip a meal or two out. We could've cooked more as there are plenty of supplies dishes, an oven, cutting boards, glasses, electric kettle, etc. (although someone seems to have made off with your mugs there was only 1 lonely one)"
1685503;27697296;2015-03-09;25774233;Ben;Migiel was the perfect host, meeting me later in the evening, responsive the one time I had a question, and overall keeping a perfectly tidy and well-run flat.  I highly recommend him to any traveler.
4010712;41065284;2015-08-04;7106919;Wybe;Although Tineke couldn't be there to welcome us, her kind friend Lara let us in. They both were great in communicating beforehand and prompt for check in. The house was amazing. Such a brilliant place to relax with friends, especially in the garden when the sun was out. You really felt being welcomed in someone's cosy home. Will definitely return for a next visit to Amsterdam.

1482998;21072093;2014-10-11;8496036;Sergey;Mary was a wonderful host. It was a very cosy stay. In flat was everything you need. The shower is a good size and the kitchen is very well equipped. The flat is in a fantastic location. Great value for money.
1482998;22296493;2014-11-03;11325439;Oleg;Квартира находится в центре, проблем с заселением не возникло быстро нашли квартиру. Квартира находится на 4 этаже с крутыми лестницами, мы были с рюкзаками и это не вызвало проблем. Квартира чистая и уютная. Есть один нюанс туалет смежный с соседями, но он чистый и это не вызвало проблем.
1482998;26591890;2015-02-16;14892321;Diletta;The apartment is very nice and good located. It's small but pretty and perfect for a weekend. Mary is kind and really helpful. She gives you all the tips and indications for your holiday. Overall it was a positive experience.

The location is very good, the apartment is cozy and comfortable.
I met Mary when checking out. She seemed like a really nice and thoughtful person, and even helped me with my stay for another night.
I will be sure to always contact her when visiting Amsterdam (I hope very soon). This was a 6 star experience and I have nothing but good things to say about her and the place.

10/10, would DEFINITELY book again."
12503509;104394848;2016-09-26;54844983;Ana Milena;"Mattijs HouseBoat was beautiful and fun experience that me and my friends had in Amsterdam, waking up looking the water was magic, enjoying the sunset in the roof was lovely and being able to connect with De Pijp, museums and the center was another good part of the location. I'll recommend this place every time I can, just rent your bikes and you will have a real and complete Amsterdam experience. 
Thank you Mattijs to you and your family for opening the door of your beautiful HouseBoat."

The house is just about 10 min by foot from the city center, and really cosy and clean. Celia was very supportive and immediately tended to all our needs and questions. It was great to spend our trip in this beautiful, historic and with loving attention to detail furnished flat. We couldn't have wished for a kinder host!"
6623194;99580521;2016-09-05;26259931;Steven;"Celia is an extraordinarily gracious host.  She provided staples for us, made excellent recommendations about the city and even drove us to the airport when she realized that she had a meeting in the area a
 couple of hours before our flight was to depart!!  She knows the city inside and out.  And provided some local color.  Wonderful host. 

The apartment is as advertised.  The neighborhood can't be beat.  You are steps to the Prinsengracht, one of the three canals girdling the city.  But The Jordaan is a residential neighborhood, not a tourist area.  For us it was ideal.  

BTW, every person we spoke with - on the street, at the grocery store, on the canal boat - spoke perfect English.  We've heard 'everyone speaks English' about a number of European city.  This is the first time we've found it accurate."
6623194;101155078;2016-09-12;88329330;Michelle;Excellent host!!! Would recommend and go back again myself!! x
6623194;101753142;2016-09-15;65512066;Maryam;"Celia is super nice and helpful. She welcomed us and made sure we had everything we needed. We messaged her multiple times and she responded very quickly. 

The apartment is comfortable for 2 adults and 1 child. It was 15-20 minute walk from Centraal station to her place and you can take Uber to and from the station for around 8 Euro. There are lots of restaurants not even 1 block over and a supermarket maybe 10 minutes away. 

I would highly recommend her place. It was a pleasure to stay and chat with her!"
13385603;99052420;2016-09-03;81747015;Amy;This was my first time travelling to Amsterdam and this place couldn't have been more perfect. It was located in a great neighborhood close to a train station that made transportation around the city so easy. And what a wonderful home away from home! The living area and outdoor patio was fabtastic! I would definitely stay here again.
11307026;93915171;2016-08-14;60366368;Joel;Leonie and Erik were extremely helpful and flexible when we were unable to make the initial check-in time.  Once we arrived at their place, they have is a friendly introduction to their beautiful home.  The home has an inviting design and looks as good, if not better, than the pictures.  Leonie and Erik provided some local info to rent bikes and eat food.  After renting bikes and eating at a place they recommended, it's clear they have good taste and I'd feel comfortable trying any other recommendations they had.  The neighborhood was great.  Everywhere we wanted to explore seemed to only be about a 15 minute bike ride away.  All in all, Leonie and Erik's place was amazing and their communication, helpfulness, and recommendations were wonderful. I enjoyed my first trip to Amsterdam and am looking forward to going back.  I'll definitely look up Leonie and Erik's place when I need a place to stay in Amsterdam.
7178130;58836587;2016-01-05;11852369;Kerrin;We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam, and staying in Angella's apartment greatly contributed to our positive experience. Her flat is clean, as-described, and well-equipped with all the necessities. I love the Oud West neighborhood as it is a bit quieter in nature yet accessible to the hub of the city (about a 10 minute tram ride, if that). Angella was helpful and gave us guidance on transportation, where to go, and the culture that surrounded us for our week-long stay. We found her apartment so comfortable, in fact, that we actually ended up spending a day relaxing and taking in the view of the canal from the balcony. Upon our arrival, we met with Angella's friend (as she was on her own adventure in Thailand) who walked us through everything and gave us a card Angella had left that included a voucher to the local Albert Heijn grocery store—incredibly thoughtful. Though I wish we could have met, we corresponded throughout the trip and I felt comfortable communicating with Angella and found her extremely warm and available. I definitely recommend staying here.
7178130;76778329;2016-05-29;5158762;Nadja;Wir hatten einen wunderbaren Aufenthalt bei Angella. Das Apartment ist sehr ruhig gelegen, in einer netten Wohngegend am Vondelpark. Angella hat sich sehr um uns bemüht und alles perfekt vorbereitet und organisiert. Wir kommen gerne wieder - dankeschön für alles.

Viola was a great host and would definitely recommend this place to everyone! :)"
13232905;112984510;2016-11-09;80917954;Luke;What a wonderful apartment. Even better than the photos! Lovely big bathroom and cosy living room. THE most comfortable bed in the world - the price was worth it just for the bed! The apartment is in the perfect location in Jordaan - a beautiful neighbourhood out of the way of all the tourists traps. I've always loved Jordaan from my previous visits so it was a real pleasure to live there for a few days! Viola is a lovely woman who kept in touch at all times and made checking in and out really convenient. we had the most perfect stay and would 100% stay here again. Everything about this apartment is perfect

3590188;17417402;2014-08-11;12183995;Nicky;Verblijf bij Stefan was heel ok. We werden goed ontvangen door zijn kamergenoten. Stefan had ook een aantal tips op een rijtje gezet. Hij antwoordde altijd snel en correct. Appartement ligt vlakbij tram en bus dus we geraakten snel in het centrum. Kamer is eerder aan de kleine kant maar ideaal voor een kort verblijf.
8946277;79413364;2016-06-12;7362951;Euan;Great place with great people: just on tram 12 and near tram 4... easy to get to and from the airport in a really nice, quiet tree-lined boulevard, walking distance to Pijp district and all that has in store. This place is a real treat - a hideaway. Even better were our hosts - friendly, open, relaxed and a real come-and-go as you please atmosphere. We felt right at home. Would definitely recommend! Thanks again.
8946277;81027983;2016-06-20;41516353;Maria;The apartment was perfect, like photos are showing. Charming and comfortable place. The neigboard was calm and very close to the center in tram. It has been nice weekend!
8946277;96131352;2016-08-21;61992709;Gabriele;Yoka is a very kind and helpful host. The flat is nice and clean and we enjoyed the large terace.
8946277;97371330;2016-08-27;71386381;Aliya;I loved my stay at Yoka's place. The flat was spotless and felt like my own little corner of her home. The terrace, which is accessed by a wide set of doors right beside one of the beds, was by far my favourite bit. Plus, Yoka and Taira were very kind, and made sure I felt welcome in their home. If you're looking for a quiet place close to the centre of Amsterdam, I definitely recommend Yoka's. Thanks again!
8946277;107572120;2016-10-11;96587858;Pritam;This was my first experience using Airbnb. Yoka was incredibly helpful on instructions for getting around Amsterdam. There home is very well located - quick access to the trams.

Tram no.2  station just take 2 mins. can bring you to museum district. Tram no.4 app. 5 mins.  direct to centrum. very good location (a bit more stair unless you have big and heavy suitcase) otherwise is a very good place to stay. 2 lovely cats welcome you.
1429701;7998047;2013-10-12;5002952;Emma;We had a spectacular time on Ayla and Jake's boat! The space is beautifully renovated, cozy, and comfortable -- and the location is also superb. We will never stay anywhere else in Amsterdam!
1429701;11021701;2014-03-17;12632716;Christian;Perfect stay on a perfect boat!!! The boat is located in one of the most beautiful areas we found in Amsterdam. Towards the city center it's 10 minutes to walk. Ayla and Jake (who are really nice guys) prepared it with fresh flowers, a bottle of delicious wine and several other refreshments and decorations. We definitely felt totally welcome. To make a long (and nice) story short: We highly recommend the boat, the neighborhood and especially Ayla and Jake! @Ayla and Jake: Thank you very much, guys! We'll be back!
1429701;15510244;2014-07-10;1602851;Jo-Ann;Jake and Ayla's houseboat was an absolute pleasure to stay on! It was well located and well equipped with everything you need. They were wonderful hosts...approachable, friendly, and welcoming. Highly, highly recommended!
1429701;20769611;2014-10-05;104846;Jessi;"Jake and Ayla's boat was the perfect spot for our brief visit to Amsterdam. They graciously allowed us to drop our bags prior to check-in so we could start exploring right away. We didn't have to walk far to get to fantastic areas of town (I highly recommend seeing a movie at The Movies, and climbing up the Westerkerk church tower!) Bed was comfy, cookies were tasty, and local beer they provided was such a nice touch.

Thanks guys for a great stay! :)"
1429701;23157854;2014-11-24;17164694;Paula;Ayla and Jake's houseboat was the perfect accommodation for our three days in Amsterdam. It was really close to Centraal Station and the Jordaan district and walking distance to Dam Square and a lot of the main attractions. The boat was warm and welcoming, with a great shower and extremely comfortable bed. The wine and beer left in the boat for us was a lovely touch too. We'd highly recommend staying in Jake and Ayla's houseboat, and hopefully will get the chance to do so again!
1429701;23758860;2014-12-09;23713918;Stephen;"Jake and Ayla made us feel so welcome. There were a couple of nice cold beers waiting in the fridge and they also bought us a lovely bottle of red wine! Everything was immaculately clean and the boat itself is so cozy and beautiful. It's in the perfect location - not too far from the centre of town and it's very quiet and peaceful. The speakers are also a really nice touch and the central heating kept us lovely and warm, making it a wonderful place to just hangout, relax and enjoy a drink. 

We had such a lovely time staying in Jake and Ayla's boat and we would thoroughly recommend it. 

P.S. the bed is soooo comfortable!"
1429701;28785548;2015-03-30;4979151;Pietro;Great experience in Ayla and Jake's boat! Wonderful place for a weekend! Near Central Station but very quiet. Very clean apartment!

Ayla & Jake were very accommodating and helpful from the moment we booked to our arrival. Excellent location close to both the station and the city. Lovely extras like the beer & wine made it even more enjoyable. Would highly recommend and definitely stay again.
1429701;37298256;2015-07-06;30169649;Paula;I cannot say enough great things about this place!! Ayla and Jake were amazing hosts, the space was beautiful, and there was wine and beer on arrival. The location and view were perfect. Even though it was one of the hottest days in Amsterdam ever, the boat was not that warm and they ensured we stayed comfortable with a fan. I highly recommend staying here! Thanks so much!
1429701;43242494;2015-08-18;25345970;Petra;"Das Boot ist vom Bahnhof super zu erreichen, sowohl zu Fuß als auch mit dem 48 Bus. Wir wurden herzlich begrüßt, das Boot entspricht sehr genau der Beschreibung. Alles ganz liebevoll und gut durchdacht eingerichtet. Man sollte aber nicht über 1,80 m groß sein, dann heißt es nämlich Kopf einziehen. ;-) Bad, Dusche, Bett alles super. Mit den Frühstücksvoucher, Wasser, Bier, Wein + Milch im Kühlschrank, sowie Kaffee und Tee waren wir von unseren Gastgebern bestens versorgt! Das Boot hat Charme, liegt zentral aber ruhig (keine Partyboote in der Nähe ;-)). Uns hat es super gefallen, können es nur weiterempfehlen!"

1429701;48984806;2015-09-30;33396441;Melissa;We were warmly greeted by Jake and his dog Max. The space was cozy, clean, upgraded and well maintained. Jake walked us through the particulars of the space, including how the heaters work. He answered questions I never thought to ask, but appreciated knowing. Unexpected perks: bottle of wine, 6-pack of beer, and a book of recommendations personalized by Jake and Ayla. The location couldn't be beat. It was a short walk from the train, tram, and ferry. Very pleased with our stay.
14172215;102797956;2016-09-19;39625986;Barbro;Läcker, nyrenoverad lägenhet med fin park i närheten. Stor marknadsgata och flera restauranger i närheten. Bra utgångsläge för vår cykelweekend. Skönt att bo lite utanför mest centrala Amsterdam där man mest träffar turister. Balkong i mycket lugnt läge. Relativt trafikerad gata åt ett annat håll men ljudisoleringen i fönstren var mycket bra så det var mycket tyst och vi kunde sova gott.

705423;3477894;2013-02-04;2066898;Pieter;Cosy apartment, good decoration, good location. Their was a bit of a smell in the apartment, specially in the bed. Perhaps there was a strong smoker before me in the apartment. But apart from that all was okay. Willem is a good efficient host!
705423;4389082;2013-05-02;3060073;Oleg;I loved this house! Location near my favorite places in the city. The house is clean, cozy and comfortable. Willem made sure that I did not feel discomfort. It is always available for support. Thank you very much!
705423;7665327;2013-09-29;6968996;Laura;Willem's apartment was a lovely change of pace.  The location is fantastic: literally an 8 minute walk (or less) to the major museums, wonderful restaurants (Mayur Indian and Red for steak/lobster), shopping, the park, lovely canals, art galleries galore, and a grocery store.  WiFi worked great, as did the washer and dryer, and the bed was comfy.  We enjoyed the terrace, as well. It was quiet and relaxing, and we appreciated the chance to unwind.  Willem was a very responsive, knowledgeable, and pleasant host, pointing us in the right direction for food and sights.  He arranged a taxi for our trip to Schiphol and it was there on the dot, as promised.  One small downside, we were anticipating the trip cost E30, but it was E48, but that was hardly a blip on our radar.  I would definitely recommend Willem and his beautiful apartment.
705423;10065062;2014-01-28;10890575;Jamie;"Recently treated myself to a long weekend in Amsterdam and chose Willem's place..... it was perfect for what I was looking for.  Great location as a base - easy to get to all my favorite neighborhoods and attractions - I LOVE to walk this city and the flat provides great access with the tram as well a block and 1/2 away.  Fireplace was appreciated for January stay.  I was late to arrive but was greeted warmly nonetheless ( thanks again :/).  All interactions were prompt and friendly.  People have mentioned the noise because of the hostels.... which you can hear when in the kitchen but in sitting room and BDR areas - found it perfectly quiet.  Have to say loved the place! Everything clean and well stocked. Comfortable but stylish.  Great Food options and markets in good proximity..... and love the airbnb simplicity! Cheers!

We were traveling to Amsterdam from Bruges at the time of the Brussels incident in March, and Scott was communicative and flexible in arranging our housing. The location was fantastic and the apartment was spacious, clean, and warm. We felt like as if we couldn't have found a better place to stay. I would definitely recommend this location and booking with Scott.

10239290;80585993;2016-06-19;62550219;Haley;"We really enjoyed our stay at Scott's apartment. It looked just like the pictures, was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Scott was extremely helpful before and during our visit. He answered all my questions quickly and made check-in/check-out easy. 

It was conveniently located right next door to a grocery store and close to the Jordaan district. 

I was completely happy with the apartment and would recommend it. Two things to be aware of- the door to the apartment is a set of French doors with big windows that open directly onto the street. So if someone is sleeping on the couch it's not the most private. Also, it is a 20-30 minute walk to the museums and/or city center if that's what you're interested in."
10239290;97699023;2016-08-28;80015784;Clemence;The apartment has a great location making it very easily accessible to the center and the trendy restaurants in Jordaan. The place is also well decorated and quite spacious and mostly corresponds to the offer except some points. However the place was too expensive due to the fact that the place has a bad soundproofing making us feel like neighbours were in the same room (eg we were woken up very early on the Saturday morning by the neighboring fruit and vegetable store ). Some reparations must be made in the bathroom as some elements are dangerous.  Note that you need an adapter for the hair drier. The Airbnb manager is very responsive but needs to include in its database our answers instead of having us repating them.

522471;11805285;2014-04-15;6308849;Eric;"Harriet was a gracious and lovely host! Her apartment was decorated very nicely and extremely cozy. The upstairs bathroom was very large and very modern with two sinks so two people can use it at once. Her upstairs terrace was great for relaxing in the evenings while looking up at the sky. Her apartment has a piano, guitar, ukulele, and other random instruments which was great for our group because we love playing music. Her kitchen has everything you could need save for a microwave. She let us use and eat anything we found in her kitchen/fridge. She let us help our selves to her coffee beans so we had fresh free coffee every morning. There were three beds (two doubles and one single) which were extremely comfy. She had cable tv, the plugin to hook up to our macbooks so we could watch movies on her tv from our laptops. She also had a record player and sound system that let us hook up our music from all our devices which was awesome! 

Upon arrival Harriet gave us a very warm greeting with a tour of her apartment. She was very open to answering and questions of her apartment and any other questions we had in terms of directions and getting around Amsterdam. She was also very easy to contact via text message while we she was away and she responded very quickly. 

Thank you very much for letting us stay in your beautiful home Harriet it was a pleasure meeting you!"
522471;67953480;2016-04-01;11088878;Karin;"A great apartement! Spacious and beautiful. Clean and well equipped. Close to tram, parking, foodstore and bakery. And several restaurants nearby. We got great recommendations from Harriet! 
Easy to take the tram to the city centre right outside the house. It´s also possible to walk. It took us about 25 min.
Unfortunately it was windy and a bit cold when we were there. Otherwise it would have been fantastic to sit on the terrace or one of the two balconys.
Everything was very smooth with Harriet - keys, practical information, quick respons, flexibility."
529174;41055963;2015-08-04;25931630;Sophie;Super Apartment with gorgeous little balcony to view the canal and watch the world go by. Lovely building and a great location for a group of friends to stay for a 50th birthday, thank you. Little delay on getting into the apartment but that just gave us more time to have a quick drink in the bar opposite and soak up the Amsterdam atmosphere. We loved the quirkiness of the building but guests should be aware that the stairs are very steep. Thank you Christian for a lovely stay.

2683956;111103692;2016-10-30;26380270;Ben;"The apartment is lovely but was being managed by Iambnb (not the host) and wasn't clean. Their check-in was good and staff appeared friendly but we had no WiFi for the duration of the stay and I'm still awaiting a response to my message from 27th October to them, asking if it could be fixed (after someone came round and checked it, claimed it had been, then ignored me; from significant work with computers, I tried all possible options but there's a connection issue and it doesn't work at all). This is the first (and last) time I'll book an un-reviewed apartment. Cleanliness was also an issue, which really let things down when we first arrived; the balcony was very dirty, with dirty sheets (which were being changed unannounced once we'd returned to the apartment about 30 minutes after checking in and going to the supermarket - unusual).

Just a shame that agencies etc. can represent places and ignore a customer completely, still gaining the fee, as otherwise this has the potential to be a 5 star apartment; it wasn't worth what we paid."
593101;18794561;2014-09-01;910537;Raphaël;Safinaz was a super friendly host and her breakfast was as great as the other reviewers described it. Overall, our experience was good, although I wished that the advertised bicycle was in a better condition (the saddle falls off). Also there is a very strong smell of incense in the flat, which might not be to everyone's taste.
593101;20828341;2014-10-06;9679208;Paul;"We received a delightfully warm and friendly welcome from Safinaz who goes out of her way to be helpful and kind. In fact she even produced a delicious meal for us when we arrived tired, late and hungry, having had travel delays.

The appartment is within an easy two-stop tram ride from the central station and is quiet and cosy. We enjoyed our stay very much."
593101;46892113;2015-09-14;25853108;Joanna;"Safinaz and her lovely daughters made me feel incredibly welcomed upon arrival. It was my first time staying in a private room at Airbnb so thanks to their warm hospitality, I felt quickly at ease. I arrived early in the morning (and she was extremely responsive over messages the entire time) after an 8 hour flight so I was rather exhausted. Safinaz made me a snack and I passed out right away.

The room is exactly as described and it includes also a hairdryer and outlet adapter. There is wifi and I had no issues using that. I had everything I needed during my stay.

Note: With luggage, it is a bit of a walk from the Central Station so do not do what I did and not take the tram (recommended by Safinaz). I thought it would be a doable walk but with stuff, its a bit tiring :)."
593101;69698385;2016-04-12;53537100;Sara;Appartamento accogliente e Safinaz è stata fantastica. Non abbiamo avuto alcun tipo di problema. Consigliata vivamente soprattutto per vedere una bellissima città come Amsterdam!!
593101;101999000;2016-09-16;787099;Dennis;Safinaz is a very nice host and made me feel very welcome.  She even did my laundry for me when I asked if I could use her washing machine.

Ce lieu est lumineux et extrêmement propre ; nous étions au premier étage - juste pour info, il n'y a pas d'ascenseur et l'escalier est pentu (ce qui nous, ne nous a pas dérangé) je conseille vraiment cet endroit !"

12500365;73305488;2016-05-08;68821238;Raoul;Super schöne Unterkunft mit Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet! Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Auch das Organisatorische - vorab wie im Nachgang - lief sehr unkompliziert. Wir wurden herzlich empfangen und würden wieder buchen. Für Events rund ums Stadion, z. B. Amsterdam kookt, ideal gelegen. In 20 Minuten ist man mit der Tram in der Stadt. Der Weg lohnt sich für das abgeschiedene Eckchen am Kanal. Sehr empfehlenswert!
12500365;110916166;2016-10-29;90006645;John;We loved our stay in Amsterdam.  Yvette is a very welcoming host with a beautiful houseboat close to the Olympic Stadium. If you want a quiet stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre yet within easy reach: ten minute walk plus ten minute tram. Then Yvette's place is ideal.
12500365;115034011;2016-11-21;3864240;Joel;"My stay was wonderful. I've stayed in quite a few Airbnbs, and Yvette was easily the best host I've ever had. Her communication was great, she was very flexible on check in, she went out of her way to greet me when I arrived, and she had lots of great suggestions for what to do in the city.

Yvette's houseboat was just what I was looking for. It's located in a quiet, residential area where I could relax. It's about a 10 minute walk from public transit, and a 30-40 minute total trip to downtown Amsterdam. The houseboat was very cute and well appointed."
12500365;135271494;2017-03-04;8046357;Kensi;"Yvette's House Boat was amazing. A very good place to unwind and it was very easy to sleep as there was no noise at night and the sounds of the water were peaceful. The kitchen was very well equipped and we were able to make ourselves picnic lunches each day and have a nice breakfast on the boat. 

It is located in a very nice area so coming home late at night was also not scary. 

We had a wonderful bath in the very large tub after a day of exploring the city and it was very relaxing. 

We were also easily able to do our laundry, which was important to us as we were on a 2 week trip with just one small bag each. 

Yvette and her daughter Sisley were very understanding when our flight was delayed and met us later than planned to check in and give us a tour. 

All in all it was a great experience and we would stay there again."
12500365;138232529;2017-03-19;74862027;David;"A charming way to stay in Amsterdam, good connected to public transport. 
Parking at the Olympic stadium was quite expensive. I would recommend to look for a cheaper parking place. 
Communication with Ivette was fast and informative. 

Thanks for that experience :)"
14946493;135539724;2017-03-05;1534705;Maximilian;Suzanne was very helpful and welcoming. We really enjoyed our time at her apartment. The park view is awesome.
1170370;19952407;2014-09-21;2279144;Gail;Asdis and Michael are musicians who live directly over the hall from this fabulous apartment. This meant we were serenaded with the sound of lovely music wafting across the hall into our light,  sun filled apartment as we looked over the canal enjoying an Indian summer's night. Amsterdam turned it on for us and it was one big party. The apartment is beautifully furnished, well appointed and close to all the sights. Our only lament is that our stay was too short. we will return
1170370;24816967;2015-01-03;22045094;Lorenzo;Perfect place to have a holiday with my girlfriend. Asdis and his wife are more precious and reliable.
1170370;43473883;2015-08-20;1435036;Max;We stayed in Asdis' apertment in August 2015 and loved it. We were immediately met on arrival . There  were fresh flowers on the table. The view is enthralling and the location ideal.
1170370;89119917;2016-07-26;18932386;Sidar;Mick was very helpful and kind. The apartment was so clean and furnished perfectly with a good view. We certainly recommend this place.
1170370;102698921;2016-09-18;42707468;Irene;"Ein sehr liebevoll eingerichtetes kleines Appartement, zentral fussläufig von allen Sehenswürdigkeiten, dennoch sehr ruhig in einem typischen sehr schönem amsterdamer Haus. Wunderschöner Blick auf die Gracht. 
Wir sind trotz unserer Anreise spät in der Nacht persönlich und sehr nett empfangen worden.
Eine meiner schönsten Unterkünfte.
Herzlichen Dank an Asdis und Familie."
1170370;116740113;2016-12-03;5739075;Thomas;Great place to stay, highly recommended.
1170370;123023892;2016-12-27;30472777;Emily;Beautiful historic home with great views of the canal in front. The interior has nice modern amenities with a small kitchen and items needed for cooking if you wanted. The neighborhood is quiet and still within walking distance to many tourist attractions and the city center. Asdis was very nice and helpful upon arrival as well. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're visiting Amsterdam!

1170370;129135522;2017-01-29;50710791;Margaret;Lovely place to stay. Classic and endlessly interesting view over the canal from your room . Your musician hosts will practice their instruments during your stay but it's a very pleasant backdrop to your Amsterdam experience and a treat if you like classical music. The studio is very clean and has everything you need . Highly recommend this as a charming place to stay in Amsterdam
1170370;139657406;2017-03-26;29253651;Birgit;Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet, ist aber angebunden an  viele Dinge, die gut zu Fuß zu erreichen sind. Keine Tram, aber in Amsterdam ist man in 30 Min Fußweg an den meisten wichtigen Stellen. Wir haben alles zu Fuß gemacht, vom Schifffahrtsmuseum (toll) bis zum Concertgebouw (wunderbare Konzerte).

2134950;14983673;2014-06-30;16371350;Magdalena;The best place to enjoy your stay in Amsterdam! Ernst’s und Marilene’s house is extremely well situated. The area is typical for Amsterdam and very central so you can walk everywhere by foot. Yet the street is totally quiet. The roof apartment is very beautiful and charming, arranged with many tasteful and original ideas. The best you can possibly do in a historical house like this. Apart from tourist guides, maps and umbrellas, which are very useful, there is a tiny kitchen table equipped with all one needs to have breakfast, tea or coffee (even a nespresso coffee machine including tabs). The hosts are very sympathetic, friendly, cooperative and helpful. This place is to be highly recommended! And we´d love to come again ...
2134950;20021483;2014-09-22;19881368;Jens;"We established a good contact already from the beginning: I always received a quick and good answer. At our arrival we received a nice welcoming and everything was set up just perfect for us. During the stay we were asked if everything was ok, or if we needed something, which felt very nice! 
We thought the apartment was accurate to the description and we did not lack anything. The kitchenette is small, but definitely big enough for preparing breakfast or a small lunch, with a sink, small refrigerator and possibilities for preparing coffee or tea. The stairs are steep and you have to walk up two floors to reach the apartment, but that was no problem for us. 
Everything was clean and tidy and just what we expected. The wifi signal is a bit weak but works in the staircase. The residence is located in a quiet street, close to all facilities  such as restaurants, markets, grocery stores and public transportation, and was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. 
If we go back to Amsterdam one day, this would be a perfect place to stay again. It is small but just enough and perfectly located!"
2134950;20434020;2014-09-29;6209875;Bastian;Typical and cosy apartment, located very central in amsterdam. Ernst and his wife were very friendly and courteous hosts. Everything has worked very well!
2134950;54935142;2015-11-25;981115;Roman;Fantastic place to stay. Ernst and his family are super nice hosts. The flat is located perfectly in a vibrant area but is still hidden from the noise streets. I'd highly recommend this place for groups up to 4 people.
2134950;77070125;2016-05-30;15543128;Jacob;Ernst was a fantastic host and his apartment was the perfect way to begin our trip to the Netherlands. The location was amazing as was Ernst's hospitality.
2134950;113900422;2016-11-14;86124533;Marina;Ernst and Marilene are very kind and helpful hosts. We got a very good explanation to find their home. We had a lot of privacy and a separately entrance. The loft was very cleany and in the small kitchen you don't miss a thing! On the big table there were some fruits for us and also an Information folder written by their own. The wireless works perfectly so we could use our mac for listening music. To say it in one word: Great!
8024854;67499263;2016-03-29;12897142;Alex;"This really is your ""own place"" in Amsterdam. My partner and I stayed here with my sister to celebrate her birthday in a unique way by exploring this beautiful city for a weekend. The apartment itself is very light and clean and modern, there is everything there that you could need and check in check out was very straight-forward. There is one bedroom, and the other bed available for my sister was a very nice pull out sofa bed (I was happy about that, as sometimes the ""other"" bed in listings has been less than attractive or comfortable, but you won't have that problem here!)  The neigbourhood was great, lots of little cafes and bars. And a nice stroll into the very centre. There is a bike hire place in the direction of the city and we rented three bikes which is the BEST and a must do in this city. There is a place just out the door of the apartment building to secure your bikes too.
Couldn't have been happier with our stay here, and Rochelle and Thijs were always contactable and ready with the answers. Thanks guys!

Just a side note to any travelers- I'm sure this applies to every city when traveling, but keep a good hold of your valuables when out and about, as I discovered that pick-pockets are really very talented at what they do! ;) ;)"

The area is very quiet and close to everything (museums, parks, restaurant, shops) and the room really comfortable (marvellous shower!). Sander was abroad, but his friend Lisbeth was very supportive with us. We appreciated her help.

It's the perfect base location for exploring Amsterdam! The room is simple, clean and comfortable and Sander is a most accommodating host.  We would definitely stay there again when visiting Amsterdam."
1266433;13138211;2014-05-20;13327438;Gábor;"We've just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam. The Library was really comfortable, it is just like on the photos and its location is excellent; all the attractions are situated within a 15 minutes-walk distance. Sander is really friendly and helpful (not only during your stay but even before your arrival if one have any questions). We definitely recommend the Library."

PS: cumin cheese .... What a delight! 
Hope to see you again

Encore merci pour tout Marijke et Sander pour vos précieux conseils et votre disponibilité. Grace à vous, nous sommes arrivés à l'aéroport avec assez de temps pour ne pas avoir à courir dans cet immense espace!

Sander hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen und nach der langen Autotour einen angenehmen Start in Amsterdam verschafft. Das Zimmer war traumhaft und bietet alles und mehr als man braucht. Ich kann jedem ein Aufenthalt bei Sander herzlichst empfehlen.
1266433;17516788;2014-08-13;6367620;Iuliana;"My husband and I stayed at ""The Library"" for 3 days before taking a river cruize. The Library was exactly as advertised. A nice, quiet, comfortable and sparkling clean room with huge bright windows and a cute and serene  private patio, excellent location, close to the heart of the city, within walking distance to the museum quarter and steps to two tram lines and restaurants.
Sander and his wife were very gracious hosts, non-intrusive but always available if we needed help. When after our departure they noticed that we had forgotten a book in the room, Sander personally brought it to our"
1266433;17689743;2014-08-16;16778412;Susan;Sander & Marijke were the perfects hosts. They went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and make the most of our days in Amsterdam. It is a gift to be able to give someone enough privacy while making sure that they are comfortable at the same time, and Sander & Marijke have that gift. They prepared personalized suggestions for our Amsterdam itinerary and materials and maps by our bedside. The Library was a comfortable, quiet nest placed in the middle of a historic Dutch canal house with lots of natural light and a private terrace. The bed is very comfortable. Coffee, tea and a small fridge were provided. And we had access to a washer and dryer which came in handy. I fully recommend choosing the Library in Amsterdam.
1266433;18939210;2014-09-03;15256513;Adam;Our stay at 'The Library' was our first airbnb experience and we were very impressed. Sander and Marijke were very welcoming and friendly hosts. We arrived slightly ahead of the check in time but they were very accommodating. Sander offered us a drink, we had a chat about Amsterdam and he highlighted many interesting places on our map including nice restaurants nearby and the cheapest canal ride to take. The room was exactly as described- comfortable, clean and private. Centrally located right on one of the canals, it was easy to walk to all the major attractions. The private entrance was ideal so we were not disrupting others. Coffee, tea and a small fridge was provided and Marijke offered to monitor some washing we wanted to do so we could go out and enjoy the city. The hosts are very respectful of your privacy and are always available to provide assistance. We highly recommend 'The Library' to anyone travelling to Amsterdam and we would stay there again.
1266433;19208592;2014-09-08;9272934;Alex;"The room was comfortable, clean and fitted with everything that you would need, including brochures and maps for attractions around Amsterdam. The collection of books in the room is quite impressive and adds a refined feel to the room as well as offering some alternate leisure activity after a long day of walking around the city.

It was a suburb location in front of one of major canals and walking distance from the city centre and many restaurants and cafes.

The host was friendly and accommodating. It is clear from their hospitality that they strive to make the stay as pleasant for their guests as possible.

Amazing, thank you for having us."

The room has everything you need including a private outside space. The hosts are very kind and helpful and have excellent recommendations for your stay. Would defiantly recommend staying here and we would stay here again if we return to Amsterdam!"
1266433;46858309;2015-09-14;7928618;Sonja;"Marijke and Sander are the best hosts you can imagine. We immediately felt at home. They gave us a very warm welcome and a very good overview of sights and good Restaurants in the area. We had a very short amount of time for sightseeing and they gave us the perfect tip what was possible to see in that time frame. The apartment is very comfortable and cosy with everything you need and exactly as described. The location of the apartment is just perfect for exploring the city as nearly everything is in walking distance. And also just wandering through the beautiful neighborhood itself is like sightseeing.
As others mentioned before, Marijke and Sander have the perfect balance of giving you your privacy and still being accessible if you need anything.
I highly recommend The Library and I am looking forward to staying there again on my next trip to Amsterdam :)"

La casa è in una posizione ottima, a meno di dieci minuti dal centro. I servizi di ""The library"" sono perfetti. C'è tutto quello che serve, è tutto molto pulito e ordinato.
Siamo stati benissimo, consiglierei a chiunque questa piccola casa!

1266433;49106153;2015-10-01;38349561;Matt;Can't say enough good about this place and its hosts. They do absolutely everything they can to ensure you have the best time in Amsterdam possible. Communication was excellent beforehand and during. The room was perfect: private, clean, and relatively spacious. Shower and wifi both worked great. I doubt I'm saying anything that hasn't been said already in the long list of rave reviews.
1266433;52394833;2015-10-29;36657226;Luciano;Sander é um excelente anfitrião. Tivemos um problema no voo de ida para Amsterdam e o mesmo nos ajudou a chegar. Muito solícito, nos recebeu muito bem e deu várias dicas sobre a cidade. The Library, apesar de não ser necessariamente um apartamento inteiro, atendeu completamente às nossas expectativas. Recomendo.

Sander und Marikje waren zuvorkommende und unkomplizierte Gastgeber. Bei der Ankunft empfingen sie uns mit kühlen Getränken und vielen guten Tipps für die Zeit in Amsterdam.

The Library ist gemütlich und mit allem ausgestattet, was man für seinen Aufenthalt benötigt. Falls uns etwas gefehlt hätte, hatten wir das Gefühl, daß Sander und Marikje uns damit versorgen würden.

Die Lage der Unterkunft ist wunderbar zentral, in einem sehr netten Viertel mit vielen Cafés und Geschäften und trotzdem sehr ruhig gelegen.

Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt genossen und würden jederzeit wieder in the Library absteigen."
1266433;68980867;2016-04-08;61056447;Victoria;Amazing 4 days spent in Amsterdam. Our hosts, Sander and Marijke were so welcoming, especially when we first arrived. They sat down with us and showed us all the main attractions on the map and best routes to get. Very friendly and down to earth couple. We were also given hints and tips of great food restaurants which we tried out and ended up having the best food we've ever tried (Indonesian) which is just around the corner from the flat. The room was better than expected, all you need, on suite, private exit to get out the building and the patio area outside was lovely. The neighbourhood was perfect location and a very nice part of town. Couldn't have asked for anything better. Coincidentally, my partner just got into comics before we went on holiday and the collection that was free to use in the Library was plentiful and added great character to the room. Marijke also gave us a recipe that she recommended since we enjoyed the Indonesian so much. So happy with our stay and we will definitely be back!
1266433;71236289;2016-04-24;30750718;Iris;"We met Sander and Marijke in the morning when we arrived, our flight landed earlier than the check-in time but they were very welcoming, gave us some great recommendations and let us leave our luggage with them while we went to explore the city.
Later on when we came back our luggage was already waiting in the room, and Sander gave us a tour and explained how to get in through the side entrance. 
We didn't see them again until we left but once in a while they left us useful maps etc. on the stairs which was great.
The location was AMAZING. Five minutes from the 4 tram  (which comes very often), and walking distance from almost anything. It was great to be able to stop by and drop off things we bought and not have to lug them around with us all day.
The bed was very comfortable and even though the bathroom was on the small side it was good enough."

We were welcomed by his wife Mariek on a day of arrival.She is a very nice chatty lady who suggested us some interesting places(considering our short term stay) to visit as well as two amazing restaurants! We tried it out and it was spot on!!!
""The Library"" is a nice clean room with its own shower, a small back garden and its own entrance what gives you certain flexibility."" The Library ""is greatly located in busy Amsterdam. It is about 20-25 minutes from the Central Station and about 10-15 minutes from the Museums district. The Hermitage Amsterdam,Van Loon museum , Bags and Purses museum, Pipes museum are all in about 5 minutes walking distance. 
Great place! Nice people!Unforgettable experience!
If I was to come back I would definitely stayed in Sander's place!

My Best,
Olga."

It's the second time I come and it's still as nice.
I really recommend the library!!!
Again thanks for everything and see you soon."

1266433;116615958;2016-12-02;42799440;Christina;Sander was a wonderful host who gave us great tips on what to do in Amsterdam. The room is very comfortable and we appreciated the tea and coffee available. If back in Amsterdam, I would definitely stay here again.
1266433;116908875;2016-12-04;3786182;Joe;Sander and Marijke's apartment was fantastic! Great location, very clean, comfortable and convenient. The hosts were incredibly facilitating and gave us a whole walk through what Amsterdam has to offer which was very useful for our trip. They were the perfect Airbnb hosts!
1266433;133702081;2017-02-24;107484999;Claudia;The room was lovely and cosy furnished with many books for reading and the location was very quiet. Sander and his wife were good hosts and gave us good advices for sight-seeing hightlights etc. We can recommend them without any objection...have a good time...:)
1025482;4273537;2013-04-23;5702600;Yulia;"Reinhart And Viveka are wonderful hosters! The breakfast was a pleasant surprise! The room is clean and bright. And it is is actually very easy to get to the center of Amsterdam, it takes a maximum of 15 minutes.
At Reinhart And Viveka's home we were like at home and we are happy to stay there again. Dear Reinhart And Viveka, thank you very much!"
1025482;5677255;2013-07-11;4453704;Andreas;"Well located and calm houseboat just north of the city center. 2-minute ferry brings you 24/7 to and from Centraal Station. ed is comfy, bathroom is clean, breakfast is standard.

Your hosts are very nice people and will leave you your privacy. Depending on time and weather, they might also take you for a boat ride in the canals and waterways....!"
1025482;6509008;2013-08-15;6816225;Michelle;"Our flight from Rome was delayed & when we arrived in Amsterdam city, we were told that the restaurants close around 10pm so we had to go for dinner before arriving at Reinhart's apartment. It turned out to be quite late but Reinhart was so patient and kind enough to stay up and wait for us to arrive, and even helped us with the super heavy bags! I am very happy with his hospitality.

When we arrived he also showed us around and sat down for a cup of tea with us. The apartment was very cozy and lovely, i liked it the moment i stepped in. And not to mention the fact that we are actually on the river!! The view was awesome :)

I will definitely recommend anyone to stay with Reinhart for every reason and to have an unique experience when you are in Amsterdam!"
1025482;8479132;2013-11-02;8315125;Carol;"Had a great time at the houseboat. So convenient to travel into the Central Terminal. Excellent breakfasts, lovely views toward the city .
Would stay here again if traveling thru Amsterdam. Good host !!"
1025482;10063338;2014-01-28;368792;Sharon;"We loved staying on Reinhart's houseboat!  It was so beautifully designed and appointed, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was stylish with a teriffic shower. Reinhart was most gracious and helpful. His breakfast was very good, and there is a wonderful restaurant at the Film Museum.  We especially appreciated the quiet surroundings and the closeness to the Central Train station.  All in all a great place to stay in Amsterdam and we will return to the houseboat on our next visit.

1025482;11240033;2014-03-26;10973823;Lucas;We had a fantastic week-end staying at Reinhart's houseboat! We loved the convenient location, only 10 minutes from the city center with the free ferry. The accomodation is very nice and Reinhart is welcoming and discreet.
1025482;14944540;2014-06-30;9156668;Claudia;Meine Eltern verbrachten hier 3 Tage. Alles war sauber und in Ordnung. Die Anbindung an die Innenstadt ist exzellent. chaffen.
1025482;16196111;2014-07-23;12136397;Denisa;Reinhart ist ein sehr netter und zuvorkommender Gastgeber. Das Boot ist sehr schön, gepflegt und absolut perfekt gelegen. Die Gegend ist ruhig und man ist trotzdem mit der Fähre sofort in der Stadt. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und kommen gerne wieder!
1025482;21333440;2014-10-15;16942155;Dana;Es gibt hier ganz viele begeisterte Bewertungen, aus diesem Grund werde ich meine Meinung eher vorsichtig ausdrücken. Also - eine Geschmacksache...ich würde mich persönlich in der Zukunft jedenfalls für eine andere Unterkunft entscheiden. Eher für junge Leute geeignet, die nach Amsterdam reisen um Alles, was sie zu bieten hat zu genießen...soviel dazu. Ich empfehle eher ohne Auto anzureisen, da die Ecke nicht unbedingt das Schaufenster von Amsterdam ist. Zu dem Gastgeber kann ich nichts berichten, da wir an einem Abend an- und gleich wieder abgereist sind. Das Unterkunft selbst scheinte sauber zu sein, allerdings gab's in dem ganzen Unterkunft ein starkes Geruch (Kanalisation?). Um das alles richtig einordnen zu können, vielleicht nocht kurz zu meinem Erwartungsniveau - ich bin selbst normalerweise in Hostels unterwegs. Da ich dieses mal den Urlaub mit meiner Mutter gemacht habe, habe ich mich für keinen Hostel entschieden.
5604637;112125257;2016-11-04;16250205;Scott;Mr IT was out of town, so he left the keys with a shop next door. From the moment we picked up the keys (10 seconds) the stay was flawless... the apartment is delightful, just across the street from the park, the street is so calm you notice when there is a bird chirping... the space is comfortable, elegant and well equipped. If we lived in Amsterdam, this is exactly the apartment we would love to live in. Thank you Mr IT.
3397690;42926485;2015-08-16;14365347;Alice;"Mascha wrote us many informations about Amsterdam, the neighborhood, and all the things we could do there.
It is a friend of her who was at the flat and she was so kind with us, evry thing was perfect. The appartement is perfectly located, near the centre, the food shop is just down the street."
7215497;82068772;2016-06-26;21159341;Aurelien;It was a beautiful week-end in Amsterdam in this flat. Ruben and his sister are very convenient. The appartment is closes to the tram station, that's practical. thank you.
4591192;26462939;2015-02-13;27014163;Andrea;"Good location in a quiet residential area not too far from the city center. Easy to find and close to public transport.
Very nice and helpful hosts who live next door.
The accommodation is an annex to the house with its private entry hidden behind the main house far from the street. Zero noise, only birds. 
The interior is quite small, on two floors connected with a small steep staircase. The ground floor is more like an entry hall rather than a living or bedroom, with a very small kitchen corner with a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. The bedroom upstairs is quite cozy with a double bed and adjacent shower. Toilets are on the ground floor, so you have to go down the steep staircase. 
The house is old, so doors and windows are not the newest, but the shower area is completely renovated and everything is perfectly clean. The bed is comfortable but it has two single mattresses so you tend to fall in the middle. Maybe an area for improvement. 
There is no TV, I did not miss it, but some people might. WiFi is OK.
The place is perfect for a single person or a couple. I would not advise being more than two. I quite enjoyed the calm and privacy of the place and I can definitely recommend it."
4591192;27758983;2015-03-11;13406903;Alexandra;The hidden house is small but cozy and clean. Renee was very helpful by giving us directions how to get there from the train station. The house is close to the metro station that takes you to the city center or the train station, in a nice and quiet neighborhood. There are shops and markets around and if you like walking, it doesn't take long getting from there to the center or van gogh museum
4591192;27875962;2015-03-14;11836225;Stefan;"Ein wunderbares kleines Haus im Hinterhof.
Sehr interessant ausgebaut mit liebe vollen Details.
Wir haben uns die Tage sehr wohlgefühlt.
Alle wichtigen Orte in Amsterdam Museen, Konzert etc.
haben wir zu Fuss erreicht.
Abends kam man gerne in den Stadtteil und das Haus zurück.
Ein echter TIP für Amsterdam."

4591192;33223532;2015-05-26;9333589;Nina;"Wir hatten ein herrliches Wochenende zu viert im süßen, sehr liebevoll gestalteten Hidden House. Es ist sehr sauber, wunderschön und individuell eingerichtet sowie (bis auf eine Kochmöglichkeit) komplett ausgestattet. Die Lage ist perfekt: in wenigen Gehminuten erreicht man öffentliche Verkehrsmittel, mit denen man nur wenige Haltestellen bis zur Innenstadt braucht. Zu Fuß braucht man gute 20 Minuten in die City.
In der direkten Umgebung sind mehrere Supermärkte, Cafés, Bars und Restaurants.
Der Kontakt mit den Gastgebern war unkompliziert und herzlich, wir wurden sogar mit herrlichem Kaffee und einer Flasche Wein versorgt. Sie waren immer für Tipps und Fragen für uns da.
Sehr zu empfehlen! Beim nächsten Amsterdam-Trip werden wir sicher wieder im Hidden House anfragen.
Danke für alles Renée und Maarten!"
4591192;35903126;2015-06-23;25741566;Jane;Renee was very welcoming and helpful. The Hidden House is a lovely little retreat. It is perfect for 2 adults, but a little tight for 4 adults with much luggage, but workable if everyone is flexible. Mosquitoes will get in if you leave windows open. It is in a very safe area with easy access to public transportation and is within walking distance to good restaurants.
4591192;44632027;2015-08-28;31086220;Ido;"A quaint little house, neat and pretty. Renée was kind and helpful throughout our stay. 
It should be noted that this house is really small, suitable for a couple, maximum parents with kids. There are no doors to separate the bedrooms or the shower room from each other. The euphemistically called ""garden"" is a wooden patio. 
One of us ended up sleeping in a hotel room for privacy, and we had to eat out at all times, since there is no kitchen, just a sink and microwave. 
Having said that, if you are on your own or a couple on a honeymoon, it's a sweet and cozy place to sleep."
4591192;44887664;2015-08-30;16929667;Kasey;"Renee was a great host! She had someone meet us at the house who explained the local area around the house, pointing out a few restaurants and bars. The house is cozy and quiet at night; very steep stairs for the upper bedroom which is also where the shower is located, so for those who can't climb a ladder, be aware. Our party of 4 adults fit just fine. Fans were available (great for air movement and some white noise for sleeping). The walk to the center of town isn't difficult, and there are plenty of trams to help get you back to this residence. I would definitely recommend; perfect for a couple's trip to Amsterdam."
4591192;45371032;2015-09-02;8919475;Igor;Renee and Martin were incredible hosts! we had a wonderful experience staying at the hidden house and couldn't have asked for a better place! It was in a great location ( great walking distances to all the tourists spots and local neighborhoods) and had everything we could possibly need! I would definitely stay again and will recommend to anyone in need!! They are amazing people!
4591192;59285819;2016-01-09;47790366;Tamara;The Hidden House was a great place to stay! I felt at home there and loved the location as it was in walking distance of everything we wanted to see. Renee provided lots of useful information before and during our stay and made herself available if need be. I will definitely recommend Renee and the Hidden House to anyone I know traveling to Amsterdam!
4591192;64752388;2016-03-08;40135938;Liisa;Renee ei ollut paikalla saapuessamme, mutta meidät vastaanottanut herra oli todella ystävällinen ja avulias, jääkaapissa tervetuliasjuomat odottamassa. Asunto vastasi täysin kuvausta ja oli todella siisti. Sängyt olivat oikein mukavat, keittokomero riittävästi varusteltu ja suihkutila erinomainen.Asunto soveltui meille kolmelle naiselle erinomaisesti.  Asunnossa oli ihana kodikas ja boheemi tunnelma. Piha on kesällä varmasti ihan keidas, nyt talvellakin se oli viehättävä. Tapasimme Reneenkin ennen lähtöämme ja hän oli todella ystävällinen ja vieraanvarainen. Ohjeet talolle saapumiseen olivat selkeät. Jokirantaan oli hienoa lähteä aamulenkille ja lähistöllä mukavia kahviloita, ravintoloita ja ruokakauppoja.

En mi opinión, The Hidden House tiene todas las comodidades que uno pudiera pedir. A pesar de ser parte de su casa, se preocupan de entregar la privacidad necesaria.

El barrio es tranquilo, con acceso a transporte."
4591192;80007745;2016-06-15;46591149;Alex;We LOVED our stay at the Hidden House in Amsterdam! Renee and Martin are absolutely wonderful hosts, and their apartment was beautiful and perfectly situated in De Pijp. Our group of four loved exploring the surrounding area, as there are so many wonderful restaurants and canals. We left rather early in the morning on our last day, and Martin made sure we had a taxi to get us on time to the train station as the buses were kind of iffy. Would come back here in a heartbeat!
4591192;93081873;2016-08-11;33187643;Helena;The apartment was very nice and cozy and Renee very helpful and kind. A very good choice if you want to spend some time in Amsterdam, lovely! We will repeat for sure!

The apartment is small but very comfortable and has everything you need for a few days visit of the city. The hosts have paid alot of attention to detail to ensure a pleaseant stay. We very much appreciated the coffee & tea supplies, the lovely smelling shower products, the fresh fruit, the bottle of prosecco, the information about the city. The garden is lovely. 
The apartment Is easily reachable by public transport and is walking distance from the town centre. 
I definitely recommend the Hidden House."
4591192;110850673;2016-10-28;16484649;Nicola;Great modern apartment in lovely de pijp. Reneè and Maarten are excellent hosts. The apartment is compact and comfortable . We were a family with two young children and it was perfectly fine for us.  We had use of the garden and the toys, balls, skateboard etc. Towels and toiletries were provided and a welcome pack of beer and waffles was a lovely touch . Thank you for a lovely stay in your beautiful city.
4591192;138567594;2017-03-20;60429676;Drew;Renee met us just as we got out of our car and was very helpful getting us set up.  We had everything we needed, and on our last night even had a great chat with the hosts on the patio while enjoying a drink or two.  Highly recommended - easy walk to city centre, very quiet and comfortable!
4591192;140509154;2017-03-30;115143635;Tabitha;"Loved staying in the Hidden House. It was incredibly clean and beautifully designed. The neighbourhood was great for us; a bit further from central Amsterdam with beautiful streets and much less busy yet near enough to walk in. We also walked to the museum area across the nearby park. I would definitely recommend staying at the Hidden House and Renee couldn't have been more helpful - or more lovely!"
2295460;33318450;2015-05-26;18731057;Jane;Geoff was very hospitable and quick responding! Which helped us a lot! - we booked just on a day before arrival. Apartment is very nice, handy & cozy. It has everything you might need. We felt like staying at friend's house. Besides it's located just in the middle of all attractions, 2 minutes from Dam square, on the canal, with nice roof terrace overlooking bell tower and roofs of Dam. And from the front side you can seat in the hammock and look at the canal with boats & tourists passing by. Nevertheless it's super quit at night and it has great sleeping place under the roof. So, you'll have chance to have fun and have nice sleep afterwards without any disturbs.
1866565;12379006;2014-04-30;14015449;Clémence;Un weekend génial sur Amsterdam, Greg est un hôte accueillant et plein de bons conseils. L'appartement est idéalement situé non loin de la gare. Une adresse à recommandée pour un séjour détendu et sans chichi.

The location is very convenient : between a boulangerie and a supermarket ! And the neighbourhood is very calm ! 
The tram to the city center was only few minutes away and the Vondelpark is very close to the flat !
Everything was clean when we arrived, and the cats are very calm and discreet !
Only thing : we were a bit cold in the room, but that's all !"

14138844;110520031;2016-10-26;3944481;Dan;"The flat is very well located within a walking distance from many point of interests in Amsterdam. The apartment is a two floor spacious and cosy. It is located on the 3rd floor with a typical very steep and narrow stair case. After we got used to it it was all right, and it did not create too much trouble with our luggage. All the facilities in the apartment worked well (Hot water, wifi, kitchen, etc.). In the very near neighbourhood you have all you need to equip your house - starting with a bakery that is open from early in the morning, supermarket that is opened early and several cafes, pubs and restaurants. Danielle and Moris were very attentive and helpfull; and made an extra effort to accomodate us earlier than was agreed, due to a change in our schedule. To sum it up. the apartment help us make the most out of our Amsterdam experience...Recommended and would come again."
14138844;111635903;2016-11-01;26168803;Jennifer;Great location, a lovely walk into the heart of Amsterdam.  Safe and relatively quiet location however I did hear traffic noise at night when sleeping in the front bedroom - OK for hubby and I but not the kids.  The apartment is charming, beautiful decor and amazing light.  Beds were comfortable with more than adequate blankets.  Everything was as described and we enjoyed our stay very much.  It was lovely to sit and people watch from the lounge room.  Very vibrant location.  The narrow stairs up to the apartment are as described so travel light but our young children navigated them easily however their grandparents wouldn't have!  We recommend the apartment to families and couples.
913470;89639463;2016-07-29;33449620;Richard;Listing was good.  The neighbors are great and the neighborhood is quiet and relaxing. Park across the street is wonderful.  Bus to ferries is quick and easy to get to centraal station.  Fresh flowers, a nice note, good information about things in the area (pdf emailed with recommendations before we got there) and a treat (dutch waffles) waiting for us.  We were there the hottest day of the year and fan would have been nice.

Marike nous a préparé un liste de restaurants et bars proches de l'appartement et ce que nous avons essayé était très bien.
C'est vrai que le lit est un peu étroit pour deux personnes mais ça reste correcte.
Terrasse agréable et calme.
L'appartement est situé à proximité du métro, ce qui est très pratique.
Supermarché juste à côté.
En vélo, on est proche de tout."

10320950;74705336;2016-05-16;15142144;Romain;Nous sommes très satisfait de notre séjour passé dans la maison de Krystel, c'est une belle demeure assez typique d'Amsterdam, tout été très propre et confortable, la maison est agréable à vivre et fonctionnelle jusqu'à 10 personnes, nous étions 5 couples et disposions chacun d'une chambre, de deux salles de bain et de 3 wc au total. La maison dispose d'un petit espace extérieur ce qui peut-être trés agréable lors des beaux jours. Notre hôte a été très accueillante à notre arrivée et a eu des attentions sympathiques, Krystel nous avait laissé des spécialités locales et deux bouteilles de vin. Le quartier en lui-même est bien placé, on peut facilement trouver des commerces à proximité, des restaurants et on peut rejoindre tous les quartiers du centre ville et musée par le tramway qui se trouve au pied de la maison en  10-15 minutes environs. En bref nous recommandons vivement de visiter Amsterdam, et de louer la charmante maison de Krystel.

A LOT of cooking stuff ) Nice big window in saloon. It is warm inside because of good climat control you can choose any temperature. We came from Africa and getting cold in Amsterdam )

We have been a bit worry about location but as a fact it is perfect. Quiet and nice district. 5 minutes to big supermarket with everything and 6 minutes to bus and tram stop, it comes every 2 minutes and go directly to Museum Square. Or 25 minutes walking by picturesque streets.

Etc etc etc. Thank a lot Arend for such a nice place!"

The apartment is nicely decorated, very clean, and there was barely any noise from the market in the street (you can close the door to the bedroom). The stairs are steep, but no problem.
Location was perfect, there are many good restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and we also enjoyed dinner and drinks at the ‘Hallen’. It’s in the same street, in a big old tram hall with food and drink stalls, it’s a hip and busteling place.
You can also make your own dinner, the kitchen has everything, and you can buy all the ingredients at the street market right in front of the apartment.
It was a great stay, the bed was very comfortable, there was fast WiFi, and the area is feels up and coming (we preferred it over the busy centre).
We will definitely stay here again next time!Location was perfect, there are many good restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and we also enjoyed dinner and drinks at the ‘Hallen’. It’s in the same street, in a big old tram hall with food and drink stalls, it’s a hip and busteling place.

14212734;95856482;2016-08-21;36060375;Miguel;Rick's apartment is very nice, bright and spacious. It was managed by Iambnb, a professional AirBnB management service. The guys arrived on time to welcome us for our check-in and the apartment was well prepared and clean. The apartment looked just like the photos and I can recommend to stay there. We had a really nice time.

We were greeted with a detailed text outlining points about the property and some sights and food within the vicinity. The location is beyond fantastic for someone who was visiting for a few days and wanted to squeeze a lot of sightseeing in. The space was larger than I expected. 

Communication was absolutely fantastic and Lody was very accommodating. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone and would happily come stay here again next time I'm in the city!"
10511347;99745513;2016-09-05;1620031;Cameron;An amazing place in a perfect location walking distance to everywhere. Exactly as described and checking was a breeze. Highly recommended for anyone travelling to Amsterdam.
10511347;112702813;2016-11-07;26549020;Anthony Quinn;The studio apartment is exactly as listed. The studio is clean and comfortable with plenty of closet space for 2 people to store all their clothes and suitcases. The shower is awesome with plenty of hot water. The host met us on arrival and went threw the basics and was really nice and helpful. The garden in the back is great with lots of sunshine for a coffee and a smoke. Another great thing about the apartment is it's prime location. It is so close to everything, but is so peaceful and quiet at the same time. I have been coming to Amsterdam for over 20 years now and I highly recommend this studio apartment for couples or a single person. Thank you Lody & Jasper... Quinn & Heather from Stamford, CT
10511347;129100157;2017-01-29;33316254;Samantha;Fantastic location and the apartment was lovely - clean, comfortable and open-concept. Would definitely recommend!
590386;41270565;2015-08-05;5440746;Irving;"Ido's home was fantastic. I travelled there with 4 of my friends (all in our late twenties). The home provided plenty of space for five adults and was only a 15-20 min tram ride to centraal station and where all the action is. 

Upon our arrival Ido provided a small handout with a map of the nearby area. She highlighted nearby restaurants and her own personal recommendations. Very useful.

There are plenty of parks nearby with all the amenities needed including cafes, restaurants, two supermarkets and a bike rental shop. I highly recommend renting a bike to explore the nearby area, especially an afternoon in the park.

I would most definitely stay in Ido's place again and would refer any friends to the location as well."
14622016;105105913;2016-09-30;1291027;Andrea;"The apt it's in a very great and expensive area, as I am Dutch I know very much about Amsterdam where I lived for 25 years, and I choose accordingly.But unfortunately it's a new office in the regio that TRYING to HELP the Apt's owners providing services like check in, DELIVERIES, and Any help need, which is called IAMAIRBNB and dealing with all needs in both sides interests. But unfortunately it's a lot of to learn and adjust still, they are not having a very good communication with each other, the impression that I got is that they are many people involved with not clue Whats is going on, because every time, you hearing something different like it's always a new assistant answering the inbox msg.
I rented that place for a month and I believe that should be possible increase the facilities and cleaning for make that price make sense.
I even got surprised by stranger that had the apt key and been sent by the office to repair something in the garden without a previously notice, I was furious!
We stayed the FULL month without face towers and replacement bed shifts, and the cleaning as suggested and offered, never took place.
Incredible, all the part missing after all the requests I did, just feel sorry for the owner that put so much trust on that service.
So it turn that Instead of relaxing and enjoy my trip, I have to deal with those type of lack of professionalism, and that is unacceptable for those high price.

I also do want apologies for the house owner, but you must know, so you can do something about it ."
14622016;128510234;2017-01-25;59483758;Kevin;Wonderful experience, the host had cookies waiting upon our arrival.

14622016;138247439;2017-03-19;110952059;Heidi;"This apartment is in a lovely neighborhood, directly on a canal.  Museums and sights are close by so we were able to walk everywhere. The Utrechtsestraat shops include everything for a great meal in the apartment - wine, cheeses, sausages, prepared foods, bread, chocolate, and pastries within a 2 minute walk.  There are also many restaurants close by serving a variety of cuisines.  We really enjoyed DenC which serves a small, but fresh and innovative menu in a lovely setting.  The apartment is as shown in the photos and has plenty of space, nice showers, and comfortable beds.  It is also quiet, especially at night, as the bedrooms are located in the back.  

This apartment needs a few more items to be luxurious.  As a reviewer noted over six months ago, more towels would be a start.  There are four towels total and they are not large.  More towels, hand towels, and washcloths, as well as extra pillows (and pillow cases to go with them as well as covers for the extra duvets), dishtowels for the kitchen, and a coffee press.  We’ve rented apartments in several places around the world and were confounded that a Keurig was the only option for coffee-making.  Amsterdam has some great roasted coffees to sample and that’s not possible with a Keurig.

This apartment seems to be serviced by a group of people that don't communicate well with one another.  We were asked the same questions by email several times when we had already replied earlier.  Some basic additions to the apartment and a better organized host group would go a long way to making a stay here exceptional.  As it was, we bought some dish towels, washcloths, and an AeroPress, had a great stay in this apartment and were able to really experience and enjoy Amsterdam."

Propre, elle ne manque de rien, il y a une TV et les serviettes sont fournies. 
L'hôte Tom est quelqu'un de très accueillant et à l'écoute, parle plusieurs langues et nous laisse en totale autonomie.

Nach 2 Stunden regelmäßigem Anläuten erführen wir von den Nachbaren, dass seine Gäste normalerweiße um 17:00 hineingelassen werden. Weitere 3 Stunden später wurden wir dann tatsächlich hereingelassen. Ab dann gab es zum Glück keine Probleme mehr. Der Gastgeber war sehr freundlihc und auch die Zimmer schön. Solange man weiß, dass man sein Zimmer erst um 17:00 bekommt eine nette Unterkunft.
9840298;110601325;2016-10-27;44062399;Sue;A lovely place to stay and really lovely room. Loes gave us a very warm welcome and we were able to check in early which was helpful.  Lovely view of canal from back bedroom.  Really comfortable bed. Would be good to get some directions from the tram stop from the host so you need to know where to get off and how to find the house - which is a 10 minute walk from the tram stop through a safe family neighbourhood.
9840298;138274711;2017-03-19;56637114;Dominik;Fantastic room. Great host. Nice atmosphere. Good price. I will be back again !
9840298;138742341;2017-03-21;53454859;Rachel;The house and decor is absolutely beautiful. The only thing that bothered me was how dirty the kitchen as well as the living area was. Also the phone number in the description wasn't accurate. We had a bit of trouble contacting the owner and my emails were going unanswered. The location of the house is about 15 mins from the airport and 30 from centre station.
818079;4297130;2013-04-25;4813987;Victoria;"We had the most wonderful stay with Otto! He is warm, welcoming and very accommodating, and made us feel at home instantly - the weather was gorgeous when we arrived, so he bid us to sit on the deck of the boat to enjoy the sunshine, and brought us espressos with little chocolates :-) what a lovely afternoon it turned out to be!

Otto also suggested we could visit his restaurant on the other side of town, which we did and would highly recommend - the food was just lovely, and Otto really went out of his way to look after us. 

The boat itself is even better than in the pictures - the lounge room is roomy and bright, the kitchen and bathroom have everything you need, and the bed was incredibly comfy and warm! We left inspired to one day buy our own little boat, the few days we spent there were just bliss :-)

Thank you Otto for a magical stay, we will never forget it!"
818079;4571373;2013-05-13;5794400;Marion;"Très bon séjour, avec un accueil très sympathique. 
Le bateau est agréable, les nuits sont calmes, et il est très bien desservi par les transports en commun. (10 à 15 minutes du centre en Tram)
Otto est un très bon hôte qui vous fera découvrir Amsterdam sous un autre jour.
N'hésitez pas à aller dans son restaurant Lab 111, un vrai régal !

Pour les français : Otto parle très bien notre langue, un vrai plus."
818079;5059684;2013-06-10;6350939;Iva Lucija;We had the best time in Amsterdam!Otto is a great host and gave us some very usefull info. And the houseboat was so nice, clean and (URL HIDDEN) seemed a little bit far from town center at first,but renting a bike was a second best idea (first was to rent a houseboat as a new experience)....just 10-15 minutes away from center!
818079;5791192;2013-07-16;6614110;Yunli;"Otto was an amazing host to our short stay in Amsterdam! He was amiable, patient in responding to all my queries, and extremely accommodating to our requests, through and through. Otto gave us a warm welcome with his aromatic coffee, and graciously allowed us to leave our bags at his side of the boat since we arrived very early in the morning. He provided us with great recommendations on restaurants, cafes, and places to visit. (We really loved the apple pies at Winkel!) He made it clear that we could reach him easily via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), should we have any questions/problems. 

It was our first time staying in a houseboat and it completed our Amsterdam experience! The houseboat was sizable, and I could barely feel any rocking motion or impact from being on the waters. I particularly love to sit by the deck, and watch the stillness of everything in the morning. All in all, it was comfortable, homey, and came with everything we needed! Also, very well-connected to the city by buses, and trams. Otto was also generous enough to provide with a bottle of wine, which was really good! 

With such a gracious host, and a charming freighter... I cannot recommend Otto + his houseboat highly enough! Do not miss out on this!"
818079;6845604;2013-08-27;4991366;Lindsay;The boat was great, Otto was very friendly and helpful. He lives on one half of the ship, separate from the flat, so was near by to answer questions. Locals swan in the canal and it was lovely to be on the river. The neighborhood was quiet but access to central Amsterdam was easy on bikes or public transport.
818079;7243260;2013-09-13;7495441;Masha;"Otto's houseboat is the perfect way to really feel Amsterdam. It's landscape is defined by canals, so why hide from the authentic experience in a hotel room? The neighborhood is quiet and friendly; it immediately feels like home. And Otto himself is a wonderful host.  I can’t imagine a better place to stay."
818079;7840032;2013-10-05;9050626;Gleb;"We had some very nice days on Ottos boat! The most important remarks:
It was like shown in the pictures: cosy, warm and with the special boat-feeling. We especially loved the fireplace and the spacious kitchen.
The bus to the city stops every 10 minutes, so the traffic connection is easy and good, too. The bikes (rentable for a small fee) were a good option, too.
Otto was a great host, very quick in communication and a very symphatic person.

We would love to stay here again, explicit recommendation!"
818079;7977460;2013-10-11;6686047;Joanna;"We stayed 5 days on the houseboat. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe, the bus to the city was just around the corner, the supermarket not far away. The boat looked exactly like on the pictures. It was clean and comfy. There was even an iPad. 

The only downside was that there was no lock for the door, so basically everyone could enter the boat at any time. Even if the neighborhood was safe and of course nothing happened, it was a strange feeling not to be able to lock the door properly."

Le bateau est tout à fait conforme aux photos, tant sur l'ameublement que sur l'équipement et les ustensiles de cuisine. L'hôte très accueillant, souriant et cool. Grande souplesse d'utilisation du logement. Il y aurait peut-être lieu de compléter l'information sur les moyens de stationnement dans les parkings publics, et le coût du transport.
818079;9128212;2013-12-09;9149350;Arantxa;Un fin de semana romantico en un entorno diferente, el barco de Otto es una maravilla, muy bien equipado sin perder su caracter bohemio, muy bien situado en una zona tranquila pero cerca del centro,en verano con el canal debe ser expectacular pero en invierno con la chimenea resulta super- acojedor.

818079;13648943;2014-06-02;11264798;Casey;The boat was very beautiful and homely. Transport to and from the city centre is very close by and frequent. If you are after a nice laid back holiday I highly recommend staying on Otto's boat. We didn't get a chance to eat at Otto's restaurant but that is something we hope to change on our next visit.
818079;34958209;2015-06-14;27920568;Trish;The houseboat was exactly as you see in the pictures.  I enjoyed my 3 night stay here.  The bus stop was 1 min walk and easy transportation to the city center.  I did not have the pleasure of meeting Otto.  The houseboat was clean, had everything I needed and the bed was comfy.  The houseboat did not rock at all and the view is beautiful.  Highly recommend staying here.
818079;50843613;2015-10-15;41736645;Corinna;Der Aufenthalt war wirklich sehr schön. Das Boot ist wie beschrieben und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und waren gerne dort. Man hat sehr viel Platz. Die Nachbarschaft  war sehr ruhig, klar war lag das Boot ziemlich abgelegen vom Zentrum, aber mit dem Bus ist man in 15 Minuten mitten in der Stadt. Jeder Zeit wieder würde ich dieses Hausboot mieten :) Es ist einfach mal etwas anderes als ein Hotelzimmer und sowieso eine besondere Art der Unterkunft. Wann lebt man schon mal auf einem Hausboot? Ein sehr schönes Erlebnis.

The boat is a little way out of the centre if you're cycling or walking, but there's a bus that passes by every 20 mins or so. 

Was really impressed by how pretty the boat is - especially on the outside - Would like to return in summer!

Thanks again

The boat is fantsatic :) Now we want to live on a houseboat forever ;) We also had good Information before the journey (how to get from shipol to the boat and so on) it was  really uncomplicated! Thank you a lot!!!"
818079;75220311;2016-05-19;53186304;Alice;Just home from a fantastic stay at Otto's houseboat and we would definitely return.  Otto's directions were clear and simple so the boat was easy to find. It really is just a short bus ride away from the city,  but we liked having a home from home away from all the hustle and bustle. There is a supermarket less than 10 minutes walk away and the boat is very well equipped with everything you need including towels, a hairdryer and WiFi.  Otto even gave us the use of his iPad while we were there. Otto was very helpful, answering our questions immediately.  We had our own space and our privacy but it was nice to know he was nearby if we needed anything. Super!
818079;80026755;2016-06-15;20044782;Amanda;Otto was a wonderful host! He made us feel very welcome, was always available if we had questions or issues. The houseboat was amazing! What a fun experience. Very spacious and clean! It was such a unique experience and we really loved it! The bed is a little small but it was nice to also have the couch/living area. The bathroom was great and nice hot showers. Loved having access to the washing machine because this was our midpoint in a 3 week vacation. I would recommend also renting bikes from Otto because the houseboat is a little distant from the center of Amsterdam but because the city is so bike friendly it was easy for us to ride to the city in about 20min.
818079;82513483;2016-06-27;12672911;Teri;Our Host was very nice and helpful.  I would suggest that he let you know in advance about bike prices and if he his offering bikes for you.
818079;90308462;2016-07-31;11550484;Andrea;"Thank you a lot Otto, we had a great weekend in Amsterdam. We loved the houseboat and the area around it. The boat was very well situated and in a good neighborhood, close to the busstop nr 48 and the tram nr 10. It was with a bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, a beautiful livingroom and was very clean and comfortable for us. 
When we return to Amsterdam we would love to stay here again."
818079;97151747;2016-08-26;7629823;Damon;Otto is a terrific host, rightfully proud of his home, his neighborhood, city, and nation! The boat is rustic and boaty. We happened to be in town during a heat wave, so it stayed pretty warm, all through the night. Otto's bikes are in good shape, and provide an excellent way of touring Amsterdam. He's a half-a-minute walk from the last stop of a bus line whose other end is Central train station, right at the hub of Amsterdam's concentric semi-circles. The entire bus ride is not very long, and it comes every 15 minutes 'til past midnight, so, while you won't feel like you're staying right in the midst of city action (it's plenty quiet and residential, out on Borneo Eiland--as noisy as it gets is on a sunny day, when the whole neighborhood makes use of the nearby swimming and sunbathing docks), all of Amsterdam is easily, quickly accessible, with or without a bike. Only after being in town for a day, did I realize how many houseboats there are in the canals around city center, so I imagine one might find reasonably priced offerings closer to action, if one so desired. We enjoyed this peaceful respite at the end of the 48 line!
818079;100403114;2016-09-09;92925176;Keith;otto was brilliant!!! very helpful, welcoming, and a super host. the area was very good, quite but only 10-15 minutes to the centre (depending on how fast you pedalled!!) we had a great stay and will certainly be going back again soon. i will be reccomending otto`s place to my friends and family

We stayed in November and the boat was still warm and cosy with central heating and a wood burning stove if you fancy staying in for the evening. 

Be sure to checkout the local area as well, some fantastic local bars within about 10-15 min walk."

Die Unterkunft ist genauso wie auf den Bildern gezeigt. Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt. Alles ist sehr sauber gewesen und der Anblick der Zutaten für ein Frühstück in der Küche hat uns sofort das Gefühl gegeben, willkommen zu sein.
Auch die geschriebene Nachricht an der Tür war sehr nett gemacht.

The community immediately around him is very friendly and inviting and we were appreciative for all of the advice and assistance Otto provided. The interior of the boat is beautiful and spacious, and the kitchen well equipped to make some delicious meals to enjoy on a table atop the boat. Beautiful sunrise and sunset and overall a magical experience. Thank you Otto. :)

3188372;28514624;2015-03-25;25859493;Anna;Appartamento anche meglio che in foto, molto luminoso e grande. Pulizia discreta, ma Sahiem è stato carinissimo ci ha spiegato ogni cosa, posizione comodissima a 10 minuti dall'aereoporto e dal centro e la fermata è davanti all'appartamento. Vacanza perfetta.
3188372;31937706;2015-05-12;10209783;Jeanne;Sahiem's wife welcomed us. She was very nice, and the appartement was really just like the pictures : clear, luminous, spacious and pleasant. It's located at only 15mn from Centraal Station, and there is 3mn walk from the tramway, so it's also very convenient. We had a excellent trip, I would totally recommend Sahiem's place !
3188372;33075557;2015-05-25;25861146;Larisa;Мы провели в Амстердаме три замечательных дня и апартаменты Сахима нам понравились. Мы прилетели вечером, от аэропорта на машине 10-15 минут. Сахим встретил нас, ответил на все интересующие нас вопросы и угостил голландским пивом. Квартира чистая и светлая, расположена не в центре города, но до центра удобное сообщение, идет трамвай номер 1 и 17. Через 10-15 минут вы в центре Амстердама. Две спальни с широкими кроватями и хорошей звукоизоляцией :) В общем, рекомендую!

Very large bed in main bedroom- perhaps too large for room? Great TV and on demand films. Close to tram stop direct to city centre.  Parking €8.50 per day. Supermarkets short walk away.

3188372;79459045;2016-06-12;18406518;Rui;Sahiem was a great host, we arrived late in the evening and he had no problem to check us in (thank you again). He also was very helpful clearing some doubts and giving us some tips about the city itself. The house is great, can easily accommodate 4 people and the kitchen as everything you need (special note to the big windowed living room). Its a safe area, with supermarket, cafes, etc just around the corner as well as the tram and train stops, so you can be downtown or at the airport in 15m. We really felt at home.

We had a great weekend and highly recommend her flat."
4697359;60416139;2016-01-23;19248625;Joris;Very nice apartment and centrally located. The three beds are not suitable for six adults, as we expected, but other than that our stay was perfect and Qilin was very helpful.

4697359;99325472;2016-09-04;54272281;Aida;Great location, beautiful apartment! It was so easy to get around, walkable plus tram #1 just a block away. The hike up the steep narrow stairs could be a challenge for some, but it's worth it when you get to the top! The rooftop terrace is especially nice with a cup of tea! There's a great Indonesian restaurant just down the street - Kartika, and a grocery as well. Overall, living in this apartment really made our stay memorable!
9642058;137540648;2017-03-16;16067246;Rachel;"This space is fairly accurate to the photos, though it is at the bottom of a very steep/narrow set of stairs which is likely very common in this area, but if you have any suitcases it could be difficult.
The cleanliness could have been a notch higher - there were cobwebs in some spaces and the water kettle did not work.
Would work best for anyone who plans to stay out late as it is right on a canal, which is very scenic and well located, but there is also a lot of foot traffic and being right at the street level, the noise was a bit of an issue as well as the lights from the street.
Overall, though, the location is great and the bed is comfortable - would recommend to a friend with those few caveats."
9642058;138268046;2017-03-19;113105036;Therin;This is an excellent place to stay in Amsterdam! The flat is quite large and comfortable. It comes equipped with a large bedroom, a full kitchen, and a bathroom. Erik is a wonderful and accommodating host. He was very helpful, communicative, and understanding. The location is almost right in downtown and is within walking distance to just about everything you could need! A scenic, safe, and exciting neighborhood.
7214386;133413034;2017-02-22;32666308;Christine;We had a wonderful time. The location was perfect and the apartment was really fun and comfortable. It was great to wake up to see the canal out our window.

689623;77202148;2016-05-30;24746008;Hannah;Katinka was a lovely host who explained everything really well for us. The apartment was amazing! Decorated perfectly & the neighbourhood is also good too. Not too crowded but still close enough to the center & the city beach nearby made our stay.

Vin was incredibly kind and helpful- he helped us plan our day, invited us to anything in the kitchen, and even cooked us dinner. The bed was probably the best bed I have ever slept on in my entire life. The room  is a 2 minute walk from the tram stop, and it's super easy to get into the Amsterdam Central station.

5142163;45409746;2015-09-02;32150484;Katie;Marleen was very fast at responding to any emails. Her father was at the apartment to greet us when we arrived and showed us around. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back. The only accident we had was the one of Marleen pictures fell of the wall and the frame smashed...Sorry Marleen! It was a freak accident
5142163;67481433;2016-03-29;11871631;Marija;Modern flat with lovely views over a canal. Very bright with lots of windows. Useful blinds on each window as you can see in in parts from the road to the flat (quiet road though). Clean bathroom and kitchen, but not spotless throughout and some minor points. Stairs are very steep to the flat (first floor), this wasn't a problem for us though. Overall a good stay and we liked being able to walk to/from town in 15-20 minutes.
5142163;67642151;2016-03-30;20687149;Regine;Everything was just perfect - as described, of course but the appartment looks even prettier in reality. We felt perfectly at home and Marleen has done everything to give us the perfect stay for Amsterdam. The appt. is located extremely good - directly near the tram station and within a walking distance of the Central Statoin + many many beautiful places in Amsterdam. So - all very perfect, thank you!!

Une des deux chambres est située du coté rue qui fait qu’elle est très bruyante jusqu’à 4-5h du mat. Sinon, l’appartement est très grand, propre.

3389300;15553651;2014-07-11;14006729;Nicole;Our stay at Veerles place was perfect in every way. The apartment is bright and comfortable and we slept wonderfully every night. If the weather is nice, the rooftop terasse is a big plus! The neighbourhood of De Pijp is really cool, with so many great cafes and restaurants. Also it´s not far from the city center, you can walk or take a short ride with the tram, which stops just 5 minutes from the appartment.
3389300;18491117;2014-08-27;19467210;Malin;I used airbnb for the first time while staying three nights in Veerle's cosy apartment - a great first impression of this site! The Pijp was such a nice neighborhood with several restaurants and cafes just around the corner. Veerle is a very friendly host and easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend others to rent this apart for their visit in fun Amsterdam!
3389300;20842310;2014-10-06;10673532;Samira;merveilleux appartement! j'ai eu la chance de loger dans l'appartement de Veerle & Bjorn ! est vraiment un appartement très lumineux et très bien amenager. Veerle nous as donner toutes les informations nessecaire pour le parking ansi que pour visiter la ville! très intentionné et souriante hote. nous étions tres bien situer par rapport au centre ville. 8min avec le tram. Veerle est très aimable car jai eu du retard avec mon avion et elle nous as acceili avec sourire malgré tout. Really Nice Stay ! thanks for all
3389300;120133639;2016-12-08;8111577;Ashley;"Stay here!! You will not regret it! 
Veerle's apartment is truly lovely. It's large and spacious but cozy at the same time. Whether it's perfectly selected panels of wallpaper, a crystal chandelier in the bedroom, or a funky shower curtain, this flat is full of unique touches and obvious attention to detail. Also, the bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in!
The flat is located in De Pijp, which is now one of the most sought after neighborhoods in Amsterdam. It is aesthetically beautiful and near a number of tram lines, but we were easily able to walk everywhere during our stay. This is a great option if you want to stay within a 30-minute walk of everything but also live like a local away from the craziness. Also, the flat is a stones throw away from the  Albert Cuyp Market which is an absolute must-see. (I recommend stopping for lunch at Mukki's Rantang Homemade Indonesian Food tent if you go to the market, which you absolutely should.)
I should also add that Veerle is a delightful host and was incredibly communicative and hospitable throughout our stay. Our first night we had a random little emergency due to a leaking fish tank, but Veerle promptly responded to our messages, came over to fix the problem, and even left us a hand-written card and chocolates. Amazing superhost!
My only note of caution is that there are in fact pets who live on-site, as there are two fish who also call the apartment home. It was not a problem for us, but if you have any concerns about feeding a couple of fish each day then this may not be the best choice for you. However, knowing Veerle, she will likely accommodate this by taking the fishbowl to a friend's if this is a problem.
In case it's not yet obvious, I would definitely recommend staying here. Stop thinking about it - book!!"

3081736;44781969;2015-08-29;1989618;Morgan;Hannah's apartment in Amsterdam is lovely, and huge! Hannah was easy to get ahold of, checked in on us before and after our stay, and had a very nice friend show us around when we checked in. My husband and I spent five nights exploring the city and we loved coming back here to relax every evening. The neighborhood had everything we needed and the apartment was very close to busses and trams that took us everywhere we needed to go. We would definitely stay here on another trip to the city.

Hannah was very responsive and very warm host.  We found her apartment clean and generally just had a nice feel.  The neighborhood has mostly younger couples or young families and generally quiet.  Her apartment is conveniently located so we found it easy to get to where ever we wanted to eat, shop, or browse with on foot.  I would recommend her place to anyone.  Both her service and the apartment made our stay a comfortable and memorable one.

6375204;40145095;2015-07-28;21833568;Mohsen;We met Jesse upon arrival. He was super friendly and welcoming. Upon giving us a tour of the apartment we found it even better than the pictures. The space is truly incredible. Beautifully furnished as well I should add. Jesse even left us beers and crisps for our stay! Jesse and Sabine even left us a welcome letter with recommendations for bars and restaurants, they even took the time to write down some dutch phrases (although going from the feedback of locals it seems our pronunciation was a little off!). The area is beautiful, outside the touristic area, a coffee on the roof terrace is a welcome breath of calm in the bustling city! The bars and restaurants nearby are all frequented by locals. This is reflected in the prices which are very reasonable. Jesse and Sabine were even kind enough to let us use their bikes as they were out of town. This is really the only way to discover Amsterdam and the city centre is literally a 5-10 minute cycle away! Upon departure Sabine greeted us and was very friendly and curious as to whether we enjoyed our stay. All in all I really can't sing the hosts and apartments praises enough! Was a truly spectacular trip and when i return to Amsterdam I would very much like to stay in the apartment again.  Thanks Jesse and Sabine!
6375204;64064885;2016-02-29;19826199;Will;"Sabine made us feel extremely welcome, she showed us around the flat and made sure we knew how everything worked. 
She even left a list of recommendations regarding places to eat (Mook Pancakes for breakfast!) and some helpful tips.
The flat is just incredible! It is furnished beautifully throughout right down to the small details and has everything we needed during our stay.
It is in a great location as we could walk into the city centre if we wanted, however the tram stop was only 2 mins away.
Staying here provided the perfect setting for an amazing weekend break. The memory foam mattress was a lovely bonus after a lot of walking during the day.
I would definitely recommend staying at Jesse & Sabine's place for a fantastic time in Amsterdam! 
Thank you so much!"
2517394;30651924;2015-04-25;25594300;Nadine;Kirsten & Martijn were great hosts, very nice & friendly. We felt very welcome in the house, the distance to the city is very good. We enjoyed our stay in Amterdam very much.
8233245;52917829;2015-11-02;21274955;Stefan;Our stay was quite perfect really, flat is fully equipped with everything we needed. Looks better in person than in the pictures and is super comfortable. Located in the area where theres supermarkets, not far away a shopping mall as well, and separated from the crazy in the central. North and central feel like entirely different cities so it is nice to stay in the north and easily go to central from there and experience both Amsterdams. Thanks guys for hosting us and being there to answer all the questions. P.S. Bath tab is amazing :)
8233245;82897938;2016-06-30;65029845;Åge;Nice apartement, Nice neighborhood and Nice hosts! Would definetly stay there again.
8233245;90067232;2016-07-31;48051164;Christian;"This place was perfect for 2 couples.  It's about a 15 minute walk from the apartment to the free ferry, which runs every 6-10 minutes, that drops you directly behind central station (super short ferry ride...2 min)

The only thing that might need clarifying is that there is only one toilet, which is on the main floor, while the shower is on the second floor along with the bedrooms.  

Liesbeth was great at returning our messages and answering questions promptly. Everything went super smoothly.  We would definitely stay here again."

The apartment is very nice, friendly, clean and with a great cd/vinyl collection. It is not very central but it is very well connected by public transport, about 10/15 minutes to reach the station.
Sebas has given us a lot of information about Amsterdam and even took us to the airport by car, truly a great host.

9308904;60090209;2016-01-18;13880761;Felipe;A really nice place in one of the residential neighborhoods of Amsterdam. The owners were prompt to help and responded our messages on time. But keep in mind the owners are not a family with a baby as depicted in the pic but just a big apartment rental enterprise of Amsterdam called Iamb&b. It is close to the tram and also walking distance from the center and the Museumplein. I would recommend this studio to my friends.
9308904;67408248;2016-03-29;42765114;M Teresa;Naomi was a very nice host, her apartment was in a very good location and easy to travel to any part of the city, it was very clean and fantastically decorated. The apartment was just as described. My husband and I had a great stay in it.  Thanks Naomi
9308904;71357905;2016-04-24;63595179;Joyce;"Nicely decorated studio and easy access with tram 17 from central station.
Friendly welcome by host in the absence of Iambnb, company who manages the rent. 
I missed a place to hang my coat and other clothes. The Wifi is quite weak.
I found it quite noisy at night due to the cafe just opposite open till 3am."
9308904;74221237;2016-05-14;69023628;Delphine;"Séjour agréable dans un studio plein de charme et très bien aménagé!
Joost nous à très bien accueillis et est resté à notre disposition tous le long du séjour. 
Petit plus pour le ponton au bas de l'immeuble, idéal pour commencer où terminer la journée au bord de l'eau.
Joli parc à 10 mns à pied, plein de petits commerces aux alentours, bref un chouette appartement dans un quartier calme sans être trop loin du coeur d'Amsterdam."
9308904;74657131;2016-05-16;39047565;Justine;"Logement totalement conforme aux photos très cosy et propre! Plein de petites attention pour le voyageur qui sont très agréables (bières, chocolat, gâteaux, serviettes, savons à disposition).
Naomie est très accueillante et tout à fait disponible en cas de soucis. 
Logement bien situé, proche du tram pour rejoindre le centre ou idéal à pied ou à vélo pour profiter des canaux. 
Nous reviendrons sans hésitation!"
9308904;78145584;2016-06-05;18792572;Joe;The room was really nicely laid out with an interesting old desk and wardrobe. It wasn't that big of a room, but there was space for the two of us. I liked having the small fridge and Nespresso machine as well. The best part of it was the location - right next to a canal, and in the Oud west part of Amsterdam, so far enough away from the tourist center of town to be quieter but still close enough to get to all the tourist attractions. There was a really nice cafe/bar right next to the room with seating along the canal to sit outside and have drinks or food in the sunshine. The Vondelpark as well is a short walk away.
9308904;97975329;2016-08-29;72163341;Serafeim;Overall nice experience. It is a small studio but it is ok for 2 people. Around half an hour walk to the city center. Thank you for your hospitality :-)
9308904;139062732;2017-03-23;5538375;Amber;So comfortable and relaxing! Easy to access the centre of town on foot or by tram, only 30min to airport! This was a great location for us to explore Amsterdam for our first trip. I like that it was in a residential area, some great restaurants nearby. Hema is just a 5min walk away for anything you forgot! Great night sleep, nice views of canal. Would highly recommend!
4820483;32122481;2015-05-14;31084357;Maya;"Lise and Jelle were wonderful hosts. We were made welcome from the moment we arrived. The location is perfect very central close to the canals, restaurants and the Anne Frank museum. The tram stop is opposite the house which is very convenient. 
The room was very nice and they provided complimentary tea and coffee. This was my first experience of staying in a air bnb and it was a great experience. I would really recommend staying here as I couldn't have asked for anything more. I will definitely return and stay again with Lise and Jelle."
4820483;32219069;2015-05-15;20404136;Nikita;"I had wonderful stay at Jelle's apartment. The place is neat and tidy. The location is amazing considering the tram stops right in front of the house and places such as the Ann frank museum, Tulip musuem is just across the street. We couldn't meet Lise but Jelle was there to receive and helped us with all our queries and gave some very good suggestions on where to eat and what to do. 
We hope to be back soon!"
4820483;37585813;2015-07-08;35479008;Charlotte;"Our stay here was fantastic! Before arrival our questions were answered promptly and Lise and Jelle were able to accommodate our check-in needs. Jelle talked through some areas of interest on the map when we arrived and should we have needed any more information not to hesitate to ask.
The room was spacious and included a hairdryer, iron, kettle, coffee maker and fridge making our stay here very comfortable. It is in a great location with a tram stop right out side and a short walk to Anne Frank's house and the canal for boat tours. There is also a small supermarket next door for those who don't want to eat every meal out. We bought pastries and ate them at the table in the little courtyard of our room. There are many nice places to eat and drink nearby, with the best apple pie served near Noordermarkt.
It is safe to say we will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Amsterdam! Thank you Lise and Jelle."
4820483;44304995;2015-08-25;37161722;Trine;Jelle tog i mod os og gav os en fin velkomst! Han viste værelset frem og informerede om interessante og besøgsværdige events der fandt sted i Amsterdam mens vi var i byen. Tulip Room var et super hyggeligt værelse, med alt vi havde brug for, og ikke mindst med en fantastisk beliggenhed. Det gjorde det nemt for os at gå rundt til alt vi gerne ville opleve i Amsterdam, og lige svinge forbi og læsse af når souvenir-poserner blev for tunge. At bo hos Jelle og Lise var uden tvivl med til at fuldende en fantastisk weekend i Amsterdam.
4820483;69885687;2016-04-14;58228542;Luis Felipe;The Room  was nice, clean and cofortable. W e stay four days  so no time to waste.  The locacion was excelent. Was close to everything. We hace a crear time.
4820483;70832289;2016-04-21;13103426;Linda;"We loved our 4 night stay here. The location is perfect, adjacent to the tram stop. We walked to many places as well including the Jordaan. The room is very cozy, well lit with the most comfortable bed I've slept in. The wifi is strong and reliable. Having the little coffee machine there was lovely. 
There are some great places to eat especially the Indian one a few doors down. Their food is fantastic and plentiful. 
The supermarket is handy is well. 
Recommend staying here."
4820483;74912068;2016-05-17;15618184;Sophia;This was my first Air BNB experience and I was blown away with how fabulous the accommodation was, the cleaner was there when we arrived as we needed to put our bags in a little early, she was so friendly and the actual flat/room was laid out beautifully, the hosts kept in contact with me in the lead up to our trip which was really reassuring and we would definitely go here again! GREAT location too!
4820483;100065137;2016-09-07;53092190;Kristina;We had a lovely stay in the Tulip Room! Simple but cute room with all the basics. Couldn't get our sleep schedule on point but overall it was a nice place to stay in a beautiful neighborhood.
4820483;100906880;2016-09-11;40627739;Anna;"Jelle è stato professionale e riservato, ci ha accolto con una breve introduzione alla stanza e ci ha fornito indicazioni su i luoghi che ci sarebbero potuto interessare, poi ci ha lasciato alla nostra privacy.
Stanza ampia e accogliente, dotata di ingresso e bagno privato, si affaccia su un piccolo cortile interno (arredamento a tema sui tulipani davvero grazioso). Ottima la posizione, dista 20 minuti a piedi dalla stazione ed è comunque raggiungibile con i tram. Vicina al centro ma anche alla zona a sud (Vondelpark, Van Gogh Museum ecc). A fianco inoltre si trovano un servizio di noleggio bici e una buonissima pasticceria per fare colazione. Nella stanza ci sono comunque sempre a disposizione cialde per il caffè e un bollitore con bustine per il tè.  Siamo stati avvisati da Jelle sul possibile disturbo causato dalle campane della chiesa di fronte ma non ci ha creato particolare disagio. Bagno essenziale. 
Straconsigliata!"

6541993;40993754;2015-08-03;7301470;Ingrid;Jaap en zijn gezin wonen in een sfeervol huis in een leuke buurt in Amsterdam. Het huis is schoon, gezellig en van alle gemakken voorzien. Met name het terras achter het huis vonden we erg leuk. Wij kwamen door uitval van het openbaar vervoer een uur te laat op onze afspraak. Dat vonden we heel vervelend, maar Jaap gelukkig reageerde flexibel. Jaap had handige en complete informatie voor ons achtergelaten. Super!
6851265;38025696;2015-07-12;3315436;Daniel;The host was very nice and easy to to be with, the apartment was rented out as a whole so we did not spend a lot of time together, the apartment is well located and clean, easy access and supermarkets etc close by. I would stay and recpmend other people to stay.
6851265;39202801;2015-07-21;36824992;Kaleigh;This apartment was beautiful and exactly as described. The view out the living room over the canal is lovely. Francois' girlfriend Carolin graciously waited an extra hour to greet us as our train was delayed and recommended some excellent restaurants in the neighbourhood. The apartment is an easy walk from many major tourist attractions including the Anne Frank haus, the Royal Palace and the Museumplein.
2398875;18498304;2014-08-27;9570287;Maria;Great flat, spacious, sunny and close to centre! Will definitely recomend it to anyone  who comes to Amsterdam.

We strongly recommend Martjin house if you want to spend an incredible stay in amsterdam
2398875;46889809;2015-09-14;19326723;Laurie;It was a lovely stay in Martijn's appartment.. The flat is exactly like the pictures. Very clean! We had contacts with Martijn during our stay by emails and let us a list of shops, restaurants, etc. near the flat. It was very kind from him!!
2398875;53356376;2015-11-08;10489205;Keren;"The apartment was really nice and spacious, a good base for our Amsterdam weekend stay. Walking distance to the 9 straatjes and Jordaan where you can find a lot of cafes, restaurants and shops. Also near to the tram and the airport express bus. 
We had a lovely stay there. No problems with check in and check out. Perfectly matched with our flights. Thanks again and your patience of our delay. 
Martijn is a good and uncomplicated host. Recommend this place!"

Wir kommen sicher wieder !!!! Danke Martijn bis bald
2398875;101315167;2016-09-12;13391621;Irina;Wonderful large apartment in a very nice convenient location. Open the balcony doors and look at the canal across the street!

995124;21165844;2014-10-12;18917408;Derek;"Emile was very generous during our stay.   He gave us the names to some of his favorite places inside the city and always answered his phone when we called to ask a question. I would definitely stay on Emile's boat again and I would recommend it to anybody else traveling to Amsterdam.
-Derek"
995124;35076526;2015-06-15;30066332;Klau;Big enough for 6 people. Good location, in a nice neighborhood. Close to the train.  Emile was very flexible with us and was very helpful with directions and he also help us get a cab to go back to the airport. He also gave us some information where to rent bicycles that's was very nice. The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. It needs to be fixed. The wifi didn't work  on Samsung devices for some reason. And there are no Mirrors in the whole boat for you ladies. Other than that it was very comfortable.
11924208;100668547;2016-09-10;91514463;Jérémy;"Anni was very nice, She explained us the neighborhood with the interest places (bakery, subway, Italian restaurant...). Moreover it was very easy to communicate with her, she replied very quickly if you send a message. 
The flat is great, clean, close to the subway (direct subway to airport, 6 stops, 15minutes) and the city : Copenhagen is easy to reach by foot. The bathroom is small and traditional but very clean, well organized, and will be renovated. 
Anni left us 2 closets to organize our clothes. 
We just had some internet troubles (warned us) but I'm sure the problem will be corrected for the next guest. I recommend this flat to travel in Copenhagen. 
Cheers !"
2001411;71130405;2016-04-23;970956;Margo;Thank you Anne for your wonderful apartment in Norrebro.  Loved the central location, bright clean apartment.  Would recommend this location for anyone wanting to explore Norrebro and still be within walking distance to the city centre and all of Copenhagen's attractions.
2001411;79087767;2016-06-11;39752752;Arber;The flat was very bright, fully equipped, in a great location with lots of nice places to eat and with two large balconies which came in very handy during the very warm spell of weather. Definitely would come back.

1390151;29312454;2015-04-06;1707659;Cecilia;Had a wonderful experience staying at Renna's apartment for 5 days in April!  The location in the city's center is fantastic with tons of charming shops and cafes in the neighborhood, walking distance to everything you need (or biking distance to any of the neighborhoods outside of city center).  The apartment was spacious and extremely clean, and was perfect for myself and my friend.  We slept in separate beds, and Renna was kind enough to set up the futon in the living room with proper bedding as the second bed (it was very comfortable).  The apartment had everything you need - free wifi, lots of linens/towels, nice kitchen with a big dining table, and a lovely balcony to overlook the apartment complex's lovely courtyard area.  The courtyard was also an ideal place to park our bikes overnight.  Overall the apartment was wonderful and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Copenhagen!
1390151;45213025;2015-08-31;42098629;Johann;Renna the host was very obliging. A tasteful apartment – prime location. Anytime again!
1390151;81640981;2016-06-24;60254370;Loic;"I rented out Renna's apartment for my parents who came to visit Copenhagen.

Loic"
1390151;117179146;2016-12-05;34352237;Jenny;Renna's apartment is in a great location in CPH, just tucked away from the bustle of the central area. It was cosy, spotlessly clean and well appointed. Perfect for a city break. We loved staying here. And so great that it is a small apartment, but has two beds, so friends can stay without having to look for a place with 2 bedrooms. Also there is a great neighbourhood bar across the street called Din Nye Ven, open late and does a great breakfast!
1390151;121011147;2016-12-13;55614416;Anne 'N Sally;Renna's place was fantastic! She was extremely attentive, and the place was gorgeous, stylish and functional! It had everything we needed and more, as well as the apartment being in a perfect location! Highly recommend!!

1220002;35972518;2015-06-23;25891936;Michel;"The apartment is very well located. The botanical garden is less than a block away and through it you can quickly reach the pedestrian streets, leading to the city center. The little mermaid is also fairly close. The neighbourhood is quiet with bakeries and small restaurants very close by.
Christina was a very welcoming host and gave us suggestions and advices on what to visit. The appartment is cozy and comfortable. We would return any time."

The area is nice, full of welcoming places to eat, and right by the botanical gardens.
The room I was in was exactly as you see in the photos. The bed was very comfortable,  the room very clean and quiet, despite the street-facing window. I slept really well.
Christina herself was very friendly, had a map for me and some great suggestions of where to go to eat and sightsee. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a cosy room in Copenhagen."

I didn't know much about Copenhagen before my visit, but I quickly realized that the location of the apartment is perfect for someone looking to explore the city. It is close to beautiful parks, and I was able to walk to all of the sites I wanted to see. It is also easy to get to from the airport or the train station.

Christina and Oliver were great hosts! They were very friendly and communicative, and they made sure that my check-in process went smoothly. They were happy to answer my questions and to offer recommendations for things to see and places to eat. I really felt comfortable and welcome in their home!"
9455327;95935738;2016-08-21;38276109;Jari;The location of the apartment was perfect and the apartment itself was very nice, if a little worn.

8360283;85871688;2016-07-13;5925458;Lisbet;El piso de Camille se ajusta perfectamente la la descripción. Es un piso estupendo, amplio, iluminoso y nos encontramos muy a gusto los 11 días que nos alojamos en ahí, además tiene vistas a uno de los lagos de Copenhague. Camille vino a darnos las llaves y las instrucciones, y fuimos muy bien recibidos, es una persona muy cariñosa. Recomiendo muy calurosamente una estancia en su piso
8360283;144603461;2017-04-16;16922148;Trevor;Apartment was great.. bright, clean & with a fantastic view to wake up to. Camille was a most gracious host & made it feel truly home away from home. Location was also perfect, 7min walk from the Metro station & so easy to get to the airport from there. Also very close to lots of nice restaurants, coffee shops etc. Would definitely recommend.
15381646;126893978;2017-01-15;84486948;Christin;"Staying at Erika's place was good, it is fairly close to the airport and in walkable distance to the city centre. Arrival was very easy and uncomplicated, Erika gave us towels and the flat was just as described. We did not see much of Erika's housemate. What surprised us, was the non-existence of curtains in the bedroom. If you are not used to that, you may feel watched, as the windows of the neighbouring building are fairly close by. Better switch off the lights when getting dressed ;)"

15521582;155910873;2017-05-29;1458611;Lisa&Tom;Great apartment - quiet, safe, clean and comfortable. Well equipped kitchen and bathroom with essentials. Fantastic location to walk to main areas but also public transport routes nearby. Highly recommend staying here.

14813301;148226416;2017-04-30;3132826;Yaara;"My parents stayed here for three nights while visiting us. It was right across the park from us, so the location was perfect. However, it turned out to be way overpriced relative to other offers in the area. The location in general is great, very close to supermarkets, bakery and metro station. But - the apartment stunk of cigarette smoke so badly, if you're not a smoker I don't recommend it. It's in a good condition otherwise, but not that large and it's very basic in facilities. 
In the bedroom, there are no bedside tables or reading lights, which meant that my father had to leave his glasses on the floor and when he got up he broke them (bad luck, true, but at 800 kr a night you expect to have this elementary piece of furniture that every crappy motel has) The host was nice, but he asked us not to use the washing machine, or the dishwasher.  All in all - it wasn't a horrible experience but it was an unpleasant stay and very bad value."
6910429;76003532;2016-05-24;50453751;Louis;"My girlfriend and I stayed at Louise's lovely apartment whilst we visited Copenhagen for a long weekend. 
The pictures do not show just how gorgeous and wonderfully decorated the room we stayed in was. 
There are so many little details that just make the room seem so lovely and fresh!
Louise welcomed us, gave us a tour and all the information we needed to know. She gave us a map and pointed out lots of great places to visit and let us know about great events on whilst we were there.
She gave us plenty of space to use in the fridge, a brand new bottle of shampoo and conditioner, as well as a hair dryer and fresh towels to use.
Louise then went to stay at a friends for the weekend and we shared the apartment with her sister. 
Her sister was also very kind, helpful and considerate. 
Louise gave us lots of details, even down to what time to catch the sun on the balcony, where we enjoyed a bottle of prosecco! 
The location was perfect for us. It took less than half an hour to get to the flat from the airport. It is just a 1 minute walk from a station.
We also hired bikes nearby which was an excellent way to get around - it is a wonderfully bike friendly city!
The weather was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
We would very happily stay here again!"
6702145;66109277;2016-03-19;50189128;Ashish;It was very nice stay at Kristine's apartment. All the arrangements were made to ensure a comfortable stay. The apartment is just 2 mins walk from Valby station which was an added advantage. I would definitely recommend a stay if you are looking for a nice 2 bedroom place. Thanks Kristine for being such a lovely host.
6702145;67696978;2016-03-30;23298900;Hannes;Alles war supper!! Sauber, viele Infos in der Wohnung und gute Lage!! Ich würde wieder kommen!!
12858292;99144414;2016-09-03;4685342;Lida;Camilla is a great host. She provided for our stay everything that we would need. She was nice to show us everything around and was very welcoming. The apartment is lovely, stylish, bright and  very comfortable. Although you need to be fit to climb all the stairs to get to it, but once you get there the view is just wonderful. The apartment is located in a nice and quite area  with easy access to everything you would need (supermarket, shops and transportation) and only a 10-15 minute walk to the center. Camilla made our trip to Copenhagen highly enjoyable. Together with our little daughter we loved staying there and exploring the city. I highly recommend Camilla's place!
688440;2597115;2012-10-13;3359486;Ludmila;It was very nice to stay in Kenneths apartment! Perfect location, very closed to the beutiful beach! Amager is really adorable part of Copenhagen. Also we liked very much the stylish design of the flat! Сommunication with Kenneth was very smoothy and pleasent! Only positive impressions from our stay!
688440;3459704;2013-02-02;2229500;Simon;Perfect
688440;18789851;2014-09-01;1425087;Sven;Very nice apartment, only 5 min. to the beach and 10 min. to the center of Copenhagen. Because the style is nearly like ours it was a little bit like coming home. The neighbors and the area are nice and quite comfortable. We will recommend this apartment all our friends. thx to Kenneth
5854944;54256373;2015-11-17;26527179;Manuela;L'accoglienza di Kenneth è stata eccezionale! Ci siamo trovati benissimo. L'appartamento è spazioso, comodo, pulito, estremamente accessoriato. Ottima posizione per arrivare ovunque. Kenneth ci ha aiutati in mille modi, parla un Inglese eccellente, è molto simpatico, ci ha lasciato delle istruzioni molto chiare su come utilizzare l'appartamento e ci ha addirittura lasciato in frigo del cibo e delle bevande per noi. Non è in centro ma vi si arriva facilmente, in compenso è comodissimo per chi come noi doveva trasferirsi in Svezia. Abbiamo molto apprezzato anche il fatto che Kenneth sia venuto per riprendere le chiavi alle 6.30  del mattino. Noi eravamo in cinque e siamo stati benissimo. Consigliamo vivamente questa soluzione! Grazie Kenneth, speriamo di rivederci!
5854944;70645065;2016-04-19;14884606;Silvana;"El apartamento está muy bien equipado, todo lo que se puede necesitar para pasar unos días fuera de casa y es muy (URL HIDDEN) cama matrimonial mejor que la de cualquier hotel.Lo único es que nosotros eramos, un matrimonio y tres hijas y una de las camas era el sillón del salón ( no era una cama)
Kenneth fue muy amable , tanto en la llegada , que nos recibio un amigo suyo, como en la salida se ajustó a nuestros horarios y estuvo pendiente de si necesitabamos algo.
La zona es tranquila y residencial y está muy cerca del metro, tren y de un centro comercial donde se puede comer y comprar.
Sin duda es una ecxelente opción para hospedarse al visitar esta ciudad casi perfecta."
5854944;138235102;2017-03-19;8266209;Samantha;Kenneth was a superb and fantastic host. He was extremely responsive from the time I reserved the place to the last day. He welcomed me to the home, had fruit ready, water/drinks made available etc. The home is the best I have stayed at  in terms of how clean, well-equipped, updated, functional and much more. The views were good, safe, close to a large grocery store and walking distance to the Bella Center, where I was attending a conference for the week. It is also walking distance to public transport like the train station. I cannot provide enough positive feedback about Kenneth. He was a SUPER host!
8758263;129762880;2017-02-02;68095385;Kasper;"Stayed with Desiree for a month, and had a very pleasent stay! Desiree is a great host, the apartment is nice and modern, and easy accessible. 

Absolutely recommendable."
13228078;103223478;2016-09-21;94305000;Diana;"Mi estancia fue perfecta, el apartamento es muy luminosos, con una decoración muy bonita y muy limpio. Se situa a 8 minutos caminando de la parada de metro, tiene una tienda justo al lado, en donde puedes comprar de todo.
Kimmie fue muy amable conmigo, me ayudó en todo momento, me recomendó sitios para visitar y me hizo sentir como si estuviera en mi propia casa.
Si algún día vuelvo a Copenhague me alojaré en este sitio otra vez. Y sin duda, lo recomiendo a todo el mundo."
16072;99963;2010-09-18;217457;Serafijn;Peter not only provided me with a very cozy place to stay, he also gave me some good tips (and a self-drawn map) on where to go and what to see during my short trip through Copenhagen. Those made me experience the less touristic, more local districts of the city. I enjoyed our (short) conversation. The  apartment is splendid and beautifully decorated. Definitely a place to go back to, or to recommend to others!
16449327;155025411;2017-05-27;26479635;Julie;Cette appart est super, belle déco, spacieux et la localisation est parfaite. Shane a été super à notre arrivée pourtant tardive à cause d'un retard d'avion. Je vous recommande cet appart
7991200;52266775;2015-10-27;46362327;Max;Anja was an awesome host! Everything was well prepared and we met her in person, she was very nice and the appartment is as cosy as it is described! We are very grateful and can highly recommend this place!
7991200;57313376;2015-12-24;13688573;Annelies;We had a lovely stay in Anja's apartment. Wa arrived quite late and Anja couldn't let us in, but she made sure we had the keys. The apartment is as lovely as you can see on the pictures. It' s also very clean. We could rent bikes just around the corner. Anja was always available by phone if we had any questions. If we're coming back to Copenagen, we would rent Anja's apartment again!
7991200;60575403;2016-01-25;50380593;Chelo;Thank you Anja for hosting us in your flat, it was perfect and was everything we were looking for! The flat was in a great location and easy to get to all of the places that we wanted to go, it was well facilitated and had everything we needed, perfect for our weekend away, we wished that we could have stayed longer! Exactly how it was described in the listing.
17295365;158072233;2017-06-05;36335883;Torill;Aage var en super vert. God kommunikasjon. Veldig hyggelig leilighet. Rent og fint. God plass. Deilig balkong. Perfekt for 2 par på ferie sammen:-))

14025281;91570849;2016-08-05;85039253;Joerg;Bettwäsche , Handtücher , Getränke  und Frühstücksgrundlagen waren vorhanden, ebenfalls WLAN- leider anfangs abgeschaltet.
14025281;111387813;2016-10-31;48997425;Amanda;Tina was friendly and very helpful in terms of recommendations for things to do and places to eat. She responded to our messages promptly and in detail. The apartment itself could have been cleaner and the bed was not particularly comfortable. We had to provide our own toiletries, etc. which we didn't mind but meant using our shower gel for hand soap as the host's was pretty much empty on arrival. The shower is hand held - this may be an issue for some. We managed to wash but struggled to wash hair.
1457670;10356387;2014-02-15;12083165;Mette;Super hyggelig lejlighed i hjertet af Frederiksberg. Jytte er samtidig en meget sød vært. Vi kommer med stor sandsynlighed igen :)
1457670;35801707;2015-06-22;3831280;Justin;Beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood!  Jytte made our arrival quite easy and was helpful in getting us settled in Copenhagen.  Awesome location and super spacious.  Next time I'm in CPH I'll definitely stay here!
1457670;93797205;2016-08-14;31926492;Claudia;ottima accoglienza da parte di Jytte che ci ha atteso nonostante fossimo in ritardo. L'appartamento, ubicato in ottima posizione, con Metro a pochi passi, corrisponde in pieno alla descrizione pubblicata, anzi sorprende per spaziosità e simpatia. Non ha un arredamento moderno ma è dotato di ogni confort e attrezzato per chi vuole visitare la città e anche per chi vuol farsi da mangiare.
1457670;97632861;2016-08-28;72285057;Elisenda;Jytte was very nice and welcoming, and the apartment is perfectly located in a quiet street between Frederiksberg and Nørrebro. The place is just perfect and very spacious, and we could even use the garden with our child. We would be happy to come back any time!
4848060;31344031;2015-05-04;30696945;MAja;Simone has a lovely apartment, which corresponds the pictures she placed on the site. It’s located near the city center, close to most of Copenhagen’s sightseeing places. The apartment was clean, cozy and very nice. We enjoyed our stay at Simone’s apartment and found the place perfect for a stay in Copenhagen. It met all our needs. I recommend the place with a clean conscience!:)
4848060;63113880;2016-02-20;3177671;Alizée;We had a very nice stay at Simone's flat. It's very cosy, well-decorated, very clean and convenient. It's situated in the heart of Norrebro, a great and animated area. Highly recommended !
4848060;65711543;2016-03-16;60766459;Jamie;Listing description was very accurate. Simone was very nice and easy to contact during our stay.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable.  Fully equipped and everything is in very good condition! Great location!
4848060;66790627;2016-03-24;16286096;Erik;Ein unglaublich gemütliches, schönes Apartment, mit Blick auf den jüdischen Friedhof, in einer sehr lebhaften und trotzdem ruhigen Gegend gelegen. Die Organisation mit Simone lief reibungslos. Sie war immer über Handy erreichbar, wenn es etwas zu besprechen gab (nur Kleinigkeiten). Das Apartment selber ist sehr gemütlich, typisch dänisch minimalistisch eingerichtet und perfekt für ein Pärchen.
4848060;98490234;2016-08-31;31555868;Roberto;El apartamento de Simone, es muy lindo y la ubicación muy cercana a todas los puntos de interés turístico. No conocí a Simone, pero su mamá nos atendió de maravillas, recomendable, confortable y luminoso lugar
4848060;107085826;2016-10-09;89857061;Hanna-Liisa;Our first time using Airbnb went    perfectly, a big thanx to Simone.  She took the time to make sure we had everything we needed to get around the city. The apartment is nice and clean, like in the pictures. We recommend this apartment to everyone!
4848060;127982047;2017-01-22;1034422;David;Lovely apartment in a great location. Great brunch places nearby! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
4848060;138502902;2017-03-20;117485315;Gavin;This is a perfect apt. for two. It is close to the centre, and easily to access with public transport. There are local shops and restaurants within the suburb and bike hire is easy. The street is very quiet and there were no late night disturbances. The Apt is very cosy and well equipped, excellent kitchen, very clean shower room, and a comfy sitting room, with a very comfy bed, Can't fault it.
1261225;84245135;2016-07-06;78812203;Cédric;"Our stay at Thomas and Nina's house was wonderful !

We were four scientists from Paris, and needed to attend a few meetings in CPH from 28th June to 06th July.
We were all surprised by this wonderful house, and really enjoyed our stay there ! 

The house is spacious (4 floors and 2 yards, 2 bathrooms !!!) and well equipped. It was cleaned before arrival, our hosts offered some wine and chocolate before leaving for vacations, and gave us a few nice adresses to go in order to make our stay comfortable. We could use everything inside the house (wi-fi internet, TV, kitchen equipments, smoothing-iron, bikes, umbrellas, etc.), and the family even provided us with towels and bedsheets. I slept in a small room on 1st floor, but the bed was big enough for me (I am 192cm tall !) and comfy. The area is very quiet at night, and at day also.

The house is well located (close to everything, between Noerport and Oesterport metro stations, close to several bus stops, close to the lakes, nice restaurants in the area, etc.), and we could attend our meetings in Valby and Bella Center quite easily (as metro1/2, S-togs and trains all stop at Noerport station). During our free time we also managed to visit a few places by walking (Assistens Cemetery in Noerbro, the little Mermaid, Nyhaven, city center, Tivoli's gardens, parliament's house...).

Lots of good things to say about this beautiful house.

We highly recommend :-)"
2885383;15881738;2014-07-17;8384664;Grace;I absolutely loved staying in this apartment! It was in a perfect location for exploring Copenhagen, close to the metro but also in walking distance to the city center. The apartment was very clean and cosy. Maria was there to greet me and provided me with a map of Copenhagen. I definitely recommend this apartment!
2885383;140542045;2017-03-30;93987176;Neil;The host canceled this reservation 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9410953;67455839;2016-03-29;1899571;Terry;This is a lovely apartment in a quiet residential area but only a short walk to the metro. We found it warm, light filled and with a well equipped kitchen.  Helle was there to meet us, show us how everything work and provided info on the local area. In addition, Helle allowed us to check in early and check out late. All in all we were very pleased with the apartment and would recommend it.
9410953;139606587;2017-03-26;9168581;Kristin;We had a great time in Copenhagen. Helle's place is spacious and light-flooded but also very cosy. We did not meet Helle, but she had everything prepared and her very friendly neighbors handed us the keys. The neighborhood is calm but shops, restaurants, cafés and a beautiful park are just around the corner. We hope to come back sometime.
4591839;40737622;2015-08-02;22076089;Alessandra;The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

7254481;50547617;2015-10-12;44509139;Sarah;"Zina's flat is very cosy and I really enjoyed my stay at her place.
The location is perfect, just a two minutes walk from the bus stops and the ferry. There are few restaurants nearby and a supermarket. 
The kitchen is well equipped, the bathroom is clean and the bed is comfortable. The flat can accommodate 2-3 people comfortably.  What I believe the highlight of this place is the view from the balcony; very beautiful. My only regret is that I could not stay much longer."
7254481;132350693;2017-02-17;112440046;Amy;Would recommend Fatiha's place! It made our stay in Copenhagen so enjoyable.
2583904;13045652;2014-05-18;14838295;Dan;"We didn't meet Michelle because she was away on a trip, but she had her sister stop by to orient us to the apartment and provide us with helpful information for things to do in and around Copenhagen. Her sister was wonderful and provided us with all the information we needed about places to see or the best deals.

The apartment itself is beautiful and the perfect size. It is very clean and open, and it has a homey atmosphere. It had all the kitchen supplies we needed. The bathroom was very nice. It was a great experience.

Also, the location is in a great place -safe, clean, and quiet. It's very close to Norreport Station by bus, and there are multiple buses one can take to Norreport, from where we could get anywhere we needed or wanted to in Copenhagen."
2583904;16415470;2014-07-27;17165817;Judith;Die Wohnung war klein aber fein und sehr sauber. Obwohl die Vermieterin selber nicht in Kopenhagen war, war die Schlüsselübergabe kein Problem und wir wurden auch sehr freundlich durch die Wohnung geführt und in alles eingeweiht. Außerdem lagen einige Infobroschüren und ein Stadtplan bereit, in dem ein paar wichtige Sachen markiert waren. Das Viertel ist sehr schön und abwechslungsreich und die Wohnung mit dem Bus ganz gut zu erreichen. Kann also absolut weiter empfohlen werden. Nur für jemanden mit Rückenproblemen dürfte das Bett nichts sein.
2583904;40999464;2015-08-03;29041197;Anna;"Kjæresten min og jeg hadde et supert opphold i Michelles leilighet. Leiligheten var ryddig og ren, med fult utstyrt kjøkken og bad, samt møbler i god stand. Beliggenheten er super dersom man ønsker å komme tett innpå Nørrebros hyggelige og sjarmerende atmosfære. Like rundt hjørnet til leiligheten finner man også gode og svært hyggelige kafeer og barer, samt grønnsakshandlere og butikker. Det gjorde det enkelt å handle inn til frokost om morgenen, samt nyte et glass vin ute i hyggelige omgivelser etter en lang dag i byen :) 
Det er enkelt å komme seg til og fra byen, enten man vil leie bysykkel, gå eller ta buss.
Kan virkelig anbefale å leie denne leiligheten, da den er i god stand og har en super beliggenhet. Leier den gjerne igjen!"
2583904;60142529;2016-01-19;20114554;Lauren;"Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Michelle, as she was away herself, but her lovely friend Andrea was there to help with checkin. 
The location is amazing, easy walking distance to Nørrebro highlights and the city centre, with lots of bus options too. 
The apartment itself is lovely and cosy, very Danish, just as the images depict. 
Michelle was great with communication and even accommodating a later checkout. Plus her food tips were great - I'd highly recommend Bæst and Michelle's apartment!
Thanks Michelle!"
2583904;65550898;2016-03-15;3880659;Vera;We had such a good stay at Michelle's cute apartment. Everything was as described, the apartment was very clean and Michelle was very helpful and such a kind person. We highly valued her recommendations -  thanks again for the good tips :-)  we really enjoyed our stay!
2583904;93025436;2016-08-11;5509261;Marc;"El alojamiento es muy acogedor y confortable, el colchón un poco blando, pero por lo demás es un apartamento bonito y más que suficiente para alojarse unos días en Copenhague, es tal y como se muestra en las fotos.
Está ubicado en la zona universitaria, un barrio tranquilo y muy bonito , mucho ambiente, y está cerca que autobuses que te llevan al centro. Michelle ha sido muy agradable y hospitalaria , nos enseñó el piso nada más entrar y nos dio cuatro indicaciones. También nos mostró lugares para comer o cenar cerca del apartamento. En definitiva hemos estado muy agusto y es un apartamento súper recomendable."
13392966;86388945;2016-07-16;34287841;Anette;The appartment had nice location in Fredriksberg. The street is vibrant with local shops, but not noisy from the appartment. The appartment was even bigger than shown i photos. Ditte responded quickly at every occation and was very accomadating and flexible.

I would do it again!"
528914;11888013;2014-04-18;5850043;Irene;We had a great stay at Rasmus’ house, it was nice and clean and located in a very charming area of Copenhagen. It’s perfect for a family with children. We enjoyed having the possibility of buying fresh bread in the morning from the nearby bakery and stroll along “Søerne”. We would very much like to stay at Rasmus’ house again.
7623631;65390367;2016-03-13;47214018;Phoebe;The apartment is very comfortable and Julie is very nice.
870150;26649931;2015-02-16;15627384;Federica;"I've seen Marcella only when I'm arrived, she just kindly explain me basic things about the room and the days after I don't have meet her again, so it was basically like to live alone and this was perfect, the privacy is ultra-respected (even if there are some strict - unnecessary - rules that don't exactly make you feel at ""home"").
The room is ultra small, and everything's exactly as shown in photos, the bathroom is bigger than the entire room and it's very very clean & comfortable.
So at least what you pay is just a bed where to sleep & a fast wi-fi, therefore I've found a little bit exagerated the price/quality ratio.
Maybe next time I go directly to a small hotel: more or less the services offered are the same and you have a breakfast included!
My suggestion to Marcella is to make the room a little bit more comfortable, maybe adding little comfortable stuff like a bedside table with a little light or just a warm duvet more in order to decrease a bit that spartan, austere atmosphere of the room and, in the same time, increase the host's sensation in having well invested all of that money. The smallest details makes the biggest difference."
460552;134625002;2017-02-28;10171257;Sara;I Would love to stay here again they  were  very helpful and the location was great for US and Rolf Sister was so sweet and kind and gave us  direction egen we were lost Thanxs for everything
460552;139695285;2017-03-26;91239978;Benjamin;"We had such a good time there. The apartment was clean, spacious and had everything you need to survive ;-) Our hosts welcomed us with a  bouquet of flowers and a package of Stroopwaffles, which was really cool! Also, there are lots of cool restaurants and bars in the neighborhood and its very easy to get to the city center from there- either by tram, bike or by foot along the waterways. If you go there by car I would highly recommend you to use the RAI park & ride that is just a 15 minutes walk from the apartment."

Just 10min away from centrum, next to a delicious brewery, a coffeeshop, restaurant, supermarket and i e cream place...all what need is just 1min away from the house. The view on the water is breathtaking, and the swan visiting you at the window was really fun :). Also need to mention that Karin was the greatest host ever, with her overflowing positive energy, offered lot of tips and help for our stay. I highly recommend the boathouse, as we are definitely gona rent it again on our next trip to Amsterdam!
6085695;47211887;2015-09-16;43150384;Jeff;"Great communication with Karin and even better accommodations.   Location is perfect for access to the trams and public transportation and rental bikes.  The houseboat is very nice and roomy with great views of the water and the windmill right outside the bedroom window.  Quiet, yet near everything.  Always fun to stay somewhere that not only reflects the ""local"" experience but also exceeds your expectations."
6085695;49627873;2015-10-05;9135662;Mandy;"Karin is such a lovely host. She made our stay so nice and made us feel so welcome, we really didn't want to leave.
We were a group of eight and were able to use those two houseboats as one big houseboat which was perfect! 
We really enjoyed our stay and I can honestly say: I doubt that any other accomodation in Amsterdam can live up to our experience on the boat(s). We couldn't have asked for more!
Furthermore, being able to directly book the boats was super-convenient for us as it made planning for such a large group much easier. 
All-in-all: We loved it! Thank you Karin :D"
3284802;17901161;2014-08-18;19635966;Felix;Exactly what you'd expect from a somewhat commercial accommodation. Nice and welcoming host & relatively clean. Everything you could need (like towels etc. and even a small kettle with cups and tea bags) is provided and dietary requirements are taken into consideration for breakfast. The guy who runs the place is actually neither Mark nor the guy in the picture.
3284802;27693734;2015-03-09;20011695;Rocio;"La casa de Igor fué, sin duda, la mejor opción. Muy bien situada, a 10 minutos en bicicleta del centro y con buena comunicación para bus o tranvía. Igor fué muy amistoso, nos hizo sentir como en casa, no parecía que estuviesemos compartiendo su casa con él, es muy silencioso. Además Igor prepara unos ricos desayunos por la mañana ;). Sin duda repetiría la experencia!"
3284802;30870702;2015-04-28;24558104;Ilaria;"La stanza ha rispecchiato le nostre aspettative: spaziosa, pulita e molto luminosa. Ottima la posizione: la Stazione Centrale si raggiunge con una piacevole camminata di 15 minuti oppure con l'autobus la cui fermata è a pochi passi da casa.
Igor è stato estremamente gentile e disponibile! Ogni mattina ci preparava un'ottima colazione (ricca, sia dolce che salata..per tutti i gusti!) e una sera ci ha anche portato una pizza fatta in casa da lui! È stata la soluzione ideale!"
3284802;31184719;2015-05-03;17905553;Victoire;"Très bon séjour chez Igor, dont l'appartement, très propre, est situé à 20 minutes à pied du centre, dans un quartier calme et entouré d'eau!
Igor s'est montré disponible et discret. Le petit déjeuner était bon et suffisamment copieux. Merci Igor!"
3284802;36378232;2015-06-28;4739140;Ingrid;"La chambre que loue  Igor dans son appartement est tres fonctionnelle et agréable ,tout comme la salle de bains et les toilettes.Le petit dejeuner superbe ;Igor est est un hote accueillant et (URL HIDDEN) vit dans un nouveau quartier que nous n'aurions pas découvert sans y habiter .Quartier calme au bord de l'eau et pas très loin, boutiques et restos sympas .Adresse très recommandable"
3284802;76814086;2016-05-29;38637494;Laura;"Igor's place is close to the Centraal Station and City Centre. Very comfortable room, clean, tidy and the coffee machine is definitely awesome. 
Very secure and nice neighborhood with an amazing view."
3284802;80273343;2016-06-17;46714677;Juan;Igor's place was very clean and very cozy.  The view from the room was great.  Very close from.the center of Amsterdam

Thx"
3284802;106641708;2016-10-07;78726671;Larissa;Eu e minha amiga adoramos como Igor nos recebeu, muito atencioso e prestativo. Meu inglês não é bom, mais Igor teve paciência e explicou tudo certinho. O local é muito interessante e bonito. Tem ônibus que vai direto da estação central a casa de Igor. E também é possível ir a pé! Adoramos!
3284802;113212667;2016-11-11;94981643;Tony;Igor was a great host.  He helped with directions for easy navigability and provided a few welcoming drinks and snacks.  Overall, we couldn't have been happier with the modern design, comfortable  beds and amazing view.
3284802;128386617;2017-01-24;61157744;Natasha;Place Is amazing!  Igor was really nice to us.  Very good location and transportation access. For sure better than a hotel room =)
13446149;89164773;2016-07-27;14989777;Matthew;Nora was a wonderful host and her apartment is in a prefect location.  bike rentals are available down the street and everything you need to have the true amsterdam experience is within walking distance.  Nora was available for questions and assistance during our trip.  Her home comfortably accommodated our group of 5. I highly recommend staying with Nora if/when traveling to Amsterdam.
9753921;114156640;2016-11-16;23527001;Maria-Pia;Location is the best, near all museums, restaurant and transportation.
12371287;82836367;2016-06-29;67155312;Iris;Ed is heel vriendelijk en je voelt je meteen welkom. Ook al zit hij vaak zelf in het huisje, geeft hij de gasten voldoende ruimte. Het huisje is wel heel nipt om met 6 personen in te zitten. Het is heel goed gelokaliseerd en makkelijk bereikbaar. Ik zou zeker nog eens terugkomen!
3718098;39007618;2015-07-20;30191203;Charlotte;Beatrice and Oscar were really welcoming and very helpful in answering our questions about transport. The flat was very clean, and really nice and spaceous. The location was perfect for absorbing Amsterdam.
3718098;50750739;2015-10-14;9000025;Daniel;"Very comfy and nice apartment - within walking distance to EVERYTHING in a quiet and nice street. Beatrice was very welcoming and helpful.
We'll be happy to stay there next time in Amsterdam!"
3718098;52821870;2015-11-02;17382388;Caroline;Beautiful apartment in the perfect location! :)
3718098;78407995;2016-06-06;20906647;David;Beatrice extremely welcoming and helpful.  Delightful studio apartment in a lovely quiet area of the city close to museums and the concert hall.  Look forward to returning next year!
3718098;102974282;2016-09-19;24038141;Paula;Apartamento muito agradável  e muito bem localizado.  A anfitriã é uma simpatia disponibilizando uma salinha onde colocar  a bagagem após o Check out.  Umas rosas frescas estavam à nossa espera:)) Sentimo-nos em casa...
11708950;71558293;2016-04-26;2441437;Suzanne;"This place is great!  I stayed here recently with 2 colleagues as we had a conference in town and the hotels were prohibitively expensive.  The neighborhood is very pretty and quiet, yet also quite close to some restaurants and coffee shops, and convenient to the city by foot and otherwise. (We chose mostly to use our feet, but Uber set us up on a few occasions too, cheaply and easily.)  It was a perfect setup for colleagues, as we had great communal spaces in which to work, but also private spaces if we wanted time alone.  The roof area is a really spectacular spot to sit with some wine and cheese, swing on the hammock, and take in the rooftop gardens and skyline.  The only note of caution I would give is if you have any physical limitations in your legs or hips, it might not be the ultimate choice because the house (and Amsterdam, in general) has  many stairs. There is a staircase to the first floor, and the second and third as well, but the good news is THE HOUSE HAS 3 FLOORS!  Totally amazing.  The other good things for me was, I could feel a real difference in the strength of my legs, just from this 4 day trip to the city!  :)

The house is also beautifully furnished, and has very interesting and thought-provoking art work.  The owner clearly has a keen eye, and probably great worldly stories to tell. Andres was not in town the week we were there, but he set us up with care, with a temporary host who was delightful and communicative as well.  I would definitely recommend staying in this lovely, funky home with colleagues, family members or friends.  It will add great memories and experiences to your trip."
288967;1411111;2012-06-04;2048616;Katherine;Erwin is great. Lovely accomodations, great breakfast, and the proceeds go to a good cause. Easy to tram or bike to the heart of the city. Would definitely stay again, and recommend to others.
288967;1547831;2012-06-24;2250031;Steve;Brilliant location, easy tram ride from the centre. Good size mini apartment with an excellent breakfast made by a friendly host.
288967;1553065;2012-06-24;2130973;Sabine;The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
288967;3456812;2013-02-01;4365084;Jacco;Really nice and helpfull. And a really nice place! Highly recommended.!
288967;4212468;2013-04-19;4450142;Joshua;"Fantastic B&B in Amsterdam with a HUGE room for the guest. Erwin is an extremely generous and accommodating host and the simple breakfast he leaves waiting for you in the mornings is just what I needed after a long night. The only slight issue is the lack of wireless Internet, but I knew that before booking and Erwin was even generous enough to let me use his computer the one time I really needed it. For the price, this room really can't be beat; I highly recommend it.  Thank you Erwin!"
288967;5817733;2013-07-17;7368638;Marianna;Nice location easy public transport access to city center.  My daughter and I had a good time.  :)
288967;9901168;2014-01-18;4180025;Jenny;This was the second time I stayed at Erwin's place and it was again really good and comfortable. I like the room and its space, the bed is comfortable and Erwin is a very nice host. I will be back!
288967;10078693;2014-01-29;10440302;屏;I stayed 3 nights in Erwin's apartment, it's very quiet, comfortable and cute. The location is perfect and Erwin is a nice host! I really enjoyed my traveling at Erwin's place.
288967;11683522;2014-04-12;4112493;Vicki;Erwin's guest space is delightful, very clean and quiet. The bed was very comfortable, and he was very discreet in using the shower at a particular time when he brings up a good breakfast. Steep stairs but worth it for the access to comfy space and attic views. He was available if needed, or to discuss suggestions for visits in Amsterdam, and has a good supply of tourist information. Erwin speaks excellent English. Tram stops nearby direct into town centre. Erwin struck a good balance of providing privacy for his guests combined with availability when needed. Highly recommended.
288967;12173305;2014-04-25;6990600;Dan;"Erwin’s place is located in a quiet, residential neighborhood approximately 20 minutes west of Amsterdam Centraal. GVB trams operate in a high frequency and offer easy access to the city. The accommodation provided was tidy, comfortable and suitable for up to 3 guests. Comprehensive breakfast was provided in the morning, comprising of breads, yoghurt, fruit, juice and various condiments. Erwin is a respectful person and ensured privacy throughout the stay. Overall, I’d be happy to recommend this listing to prospective guests.

Note: Internet is not available at the property, so purchasing a prepaid SIM prior to your arrival is recommended."
288967;13563170;2014-05-31;11216401;Michael;Great, easy accommodation experience. Nice room, location and friendly host. Thanks a lot:-)
288967;14674839;2014-06-24;81302;Dianne;IErwin was the perfect host. His place was lovely and convenient to everything by tram. The breakfast was great too. I felt very safe in the neighbourhood too. Thanks Erwin
288967;19926273;2014-09-21;3886466;Barbara;super-locatie, mooie kamer, vriendelijke host! We komen graag een keer terug.
288967;21080047;2014-10-11;9098285;Grace Juhae;Erwin's place was amazing. I had a very relaxing stay after long day of exploring. He is also a warm, sweet host who really goes out of the way to make you feel at home. I would recommend his place to all my friends. Thanks Erwin for making Amsterdam experience special!
288967;33978813;2015-06-03;396617;Stefan;Erwin was an easy-going and communicative host and made me feel welcome in his apartment. He offered a a large and comfortable guest room with its own shower and toilet. The apartment is in a quiet and safe area as well as close to the city centre. I can highly recommend this accomodation to everyone visiting Amsterdam. Thank you for the very pleasant stay, Erwin!
705423;12269458;2014-04-28;1967490;Urs;Really nice and cosy apartment in the centre of the canals. Everything was well prepared, thanks a lot Willem!
705423;21889316;2014-10-26;11402176;Hunter;The apartment was in a fantastic location. Willem was very accommodating, and check in/out was super easy. Would definitely reccomend this apartment.
705423;29483979;2015-04-08;9342923;Jemma;"I would like to agree with every other review on here that states how welcoming Willem was, from the moment I inquired about the apartment right up to when we left . He even bought us logs for the real working fire place! Willem opened his beautiful home to us and we couldn't have had a more perfect stay. The apartment is just like its pictures, with a lovely finish it's perfectly formed and homely. The location is quite yet very central, only a few minutes walk to anything you need. The outside area is a great addition to the apartment and we spent as much time out there as we could.

Thanks Willem, we look forward to coming back soon!"
705423;51762070;2015-10-24;44064231;Hasan;"Man just say: this is my first time using Airbnb and Willem made this experience spectacular. I loved the space, the outdoor patio, and most of all the location. This visit was my third to Amsterdam but this time I felt at home. neat, clean and fully equipped.

I would recommend Willem apartment to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
705423;73338932;2016-05-08;24974571;Kevin;There's a delicious cafe right next door!
705423;99175311;2016-09-03;29112614;Joey;I had a great time in the apartment. The location was perfect and near everything. Also, there was lots of privacy.
28658;103271;2010-09-23;138386;Isabella & Gary;Wonderful apartment. It is easy to get to and it is very clean and Michele is a very thoughtful host. He has a beautiful kitchen and the bedroom is great. Michele makes everything spotless. My wife and I had an excellent stay. A big THANKS to Michele. Highly recommended. We will stay again when we visit Amsterdam, that is 100% for sure.
28658;146423;2010-11-29;274590;Eymen;"Thank you For the breakfast and the tips Michele.
It is a good choice pick this one :) ..."
28658;258515;2011-05-10;515429;Charles;"Had a great stay at Michele's house. 

The place is nice and well equiped. It's not center city but honestly well located as closed from the centre and the major parks by bike."
28658;262184;2011-05-13;551712;Bill;"Michele is Vern nice and hospitable. His place is centrally located enough so we had no problem walking thru--out the city. 

We came planning to cycle in Holland, so we brought our hybrid Trek cycles. Although nearly everyone in Amsterdam has at least one bike, they do not leave good cycles on the street. The city also has one of the World's highest theft rate for cycles.  Michele rents out two rooms.  As the other room was vacant, he suggested we place our bikes in it. 

The two flights of steps up were narrow and extremely steep. My wife would not have been able to get her bike up or down by herself. 

The bedrooms are very small, yet have storage for your clothes."
28658;299641;2011-06-06;459925;Amy;Michele's place was very nice!  We were there for two nights, and we felt very much at home.  He provided a yummy breakfast each morning, including pastry, coffee, and juice, and we were able to do laundry before we headed to our next destination.  He was also very accommidating to our travel schedule.  He met us during his workday to give us a key and pointed us to the correct bus stop to find our way to his place.  The location is a bit outside of the city centre, but the bus and tram were easy to navigate, and the walk was only about 25 minutes.  We would definitely recommend him as a host!
28658;368105;2011-07-12;497640;Patricea;The apartment is as described and shown, cozy and welcoming. At times, it felt like we were the only ones around, even though Michele was present in his own room. He was very welcoming and patient with our two young kids. The tram stop to Dam Square is a short walk from his block, and there are a handful of eateries around the corner too. The only slight inconvenience is that the apartment is on the third level up stairs that have small steps, so it can be a slight struggle if you have plenty of heavy luggage, like we did. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here, and would return if we are ever in Amsterdam again.
28658;604862;2011-10-06;1215536;Christina;It was my first time staying with someone via airbnb and I cannot recommend it enough. Our host, MIchele, was very friendly, answered quickly to enquiries, kept everything tidy and clean and served us a small breakfast every morning: in general made us feel welcome. The location itself is easy to reach via public transport. All in all, I can definitely recommend this host. Thanks again !
28658;679717;2011-11-01;920743;Jola;"We enjoyed the stay a lot! Amsterdam is a very nice city! With friendly and beautiful people.
The location of the flat is great. Next to the canal and a park. Around you can find a lot of shops, cafes and etc. Good district!  
The flat itself is very cozy and nice with a gorgeous cat! She is the cutest animal on earth :) And of course the owner is kind, friendly and helpful! 
Our trip was wonderful! We rented bikes and it's took us just 10-15min till Dam! Jola & Irene"
28658;822922;2012-01-02;1346672;Julien;"We had a really nice stay by Michele, who supplied us a lot of informations, small breakfast, coffee or tea, quiet room, near to the center and a gorgeous friendly cat!!! Thank you, it was really nice!

28658;1214461;2012-05-02;1111792;Caroline;"We had a great time at Michele's place. The two rooms where perfect for two couples, the whole apartment was perfect and clean. Michele always had some coffee and breakfast roles for us. If we come back to Amsterdam we would definitely stay with Michele again. Also his gorgeous cat Patsy is a big plus factor ;-)"
28658;1684016;2012-07-11;2432067;Calvin;"Michele was great! He had some breakfast rolls for us each morning and had tea bags/coffee for us to use. Everything was clean and very tidy.  Unfortunately, i also realized I had was allergic to cats when I stayed here. Haha, my fault! But the cat was very cute and friendly. The location is very close to all the action; it was about a 15 min train ride to Amsterdam Central."
28658;3518174;2013-02-11;4097130;Anna;Our stay in Amsterdam was short but very nice. Michele made it really uncomplicated as I admit that we arrived pretty late on Friday (thanks for being at home that evening/night!). He´s very sympathatic. The place was cosy and good lacated for us! and his cat- it´s cute :-)!
28658;3973230;2013-04-01;4802030;Olga;Michele is a very nice and helpful host. The apartement is near to the city and very comfortable. A metro station is just a few steps away. We had a great time there. Thank you!
28658;4223324;2013-04-20;5456393;Natalia;"I like this apartment. Really - near city center and very easy to get. Supermarket was close. The owner was friendly and helped us :) Though I tortured him with questions :))))
Thank you for all, Michele!"

A clean and nice place to stay, very very close to bus and tram stop to get centraal station, dam square, museum district etc. 
Thank you Michele, hope to see you later"

28658;10145352;2014-02-03;9939749;Annette;"The room and bathroom were clean. The beds were good and the location not too noisy. Michele was friendly and easy as a host. Only the breakfast was a little weak, just coffee and brioche. So that could be optimized:)
Cheers

28658;10657992;2014-03-02;6133924;Kerstin;"Clean apartment, close to the center ( 30 min walk or 15 min with the bus) and well equipped kitchen.
The little cat was very attached."

Michele e la sua gatta Patsy sono molto ospitali e gentili. Appartamento consigliato per chi vuole sentirsi a casa
28658;21130975;2014-10-12;3264932;Hayley;My friend and I had an awesome experience in Amsterdam. Michele and his cat Patsy were very welcoming. The flat  is clean and beds are very comfortable. Location is perfect. Would definitely stay here again!
28658;22585326;2014-11-10;19956124;Samuele;Posso confermare quanto affermato negli altri commenti. Michele è molto ospitale, la piccola Patsy una coccolona. La casa è comoda e molto ben collegata giorno e notte.
28658;25358310;2015-01-13;17792576;Daniela;"Michele fue muy amable conmigo y mi pareja.
Nos dio las instrucciones necesarias para llegar a su departamento desde la estación de trenes.
Al llegar nos recibió de manera cálida y nos explicó brevemente el funcionamiento del departamento, esa fue una de las pocas veces que los vimos.
Nunca nos interrumpió en nada y nos dio la libertad necesaria para sentirnos cómodos y que su casa fuera nuestra casa.
Nuestra habitación estaba limpia y el desayuno era bueno.
El departamento no estaba en el centro, pero estaba bien ubicado. A pocos metros se puede tomar el bus 18 y los tram 12, 13 y 14 que te llevan a todos los lugares más concurridos (centro, museos, atracciones turísticas)."
28658;47959881;2015-09-22;34742958;Verena;Alles war sehr schön vorbereitet, sogar mit Handtüchern. Wir wurden herzlich willkommen geheißen, Michele hat uns alles gezeigt und war für Fragen immer da. Das Zimmer ist gemütlich und alles sehr sauber. Man braucht nicht lang ins Zentrum. Es geht sowohl zu Fuß als auch öffentlich sehr schnell.auch im Museumsdistrikt ist man sofort. Und die Katze ist zauberhaft :)

Très bon séjour à Amsterdam"
28658;82908085;2016-06-30;18634433;Alex;"Clean and tidy apartment. Michele was nice and his cat is really funny.
The room was a bit tiny for 2 persons plus our luggages and a bit noisy due to the proximity of the street and cars."
28658;99232098;2016-09-04;83047647;Pascal;"This place is fantastic for a good immersion in the city and its life.
Room is like describe on the website page.
Thanks to Michele for is welcome and kindness.  Pasty (his cat) is lovely ! 

There is convenient transport network direct in front of the apartment, all day and night. Very useful for quick and short travels in central town 

I highly recommend this place.. Thanks for all"
28658;112490756;2016-11-06;33759900;Julie;"Michele a été très accueillant ainsi que son chat, n'hésitez pas à lui demander conseil! Un arrêt de tram et de bus se trouve juste en dessous de l'appartement, donc très pratique pour parcourir Amsterdam. Il est même possible de rejoindre le centre ville à pied.
Je conseille vivement ce logement !"
28658;132993200;2017-02-20;10103342;Angie;Michele is an excellent host, with a very beautiful place in Amsterdam. The house is super tidy, and his cat is the absolute best. We kind of miss her more than Amsterdam.
28658;137941776;2017-03-18;64386065;Nicole;We spent an amazing time at Michele's room. Michele provides guests with breakfast (orange juice, milk and yummy cereal) and even changed our bed sheets, he's very sweet, he should be a superhost! The cat is adorable, we miss her already. We felt very comfortable here, we will definitely stay here again.
3301556;17375789;2014-08-11;18271803;Kaj Verner;"Remy's apartment has a great location for exploring Amsterdam. 
All tourist attractions are accessible by foot or (even better) by bicycle, which we highly recommend. Several rent-a-bike stores are very close to Remy's apartment. Public transport options are in front of the Apartment. The neighborhood is quiet, but still there are nice restaurants and cafe's around. Nice grocery stores and bakeries near by. 

The apartment is so cosy. It is furnished in a style, just as shown on the photographs. It is “home away from home”. The apartment is bright, well equipped and big enough for a party of 4 travelers. 

We did not get a chance to meet Remy, as he was away when we arrived. But he organized everything perfectly for us and was always available for questions and advice by mail or text messages.  Everything worked very well, we can highly recommend this apartment for a family vacation.

August 2014"
3301556;19206410;2014-09-08;10118442;Jason;"Remy was very friendly and helpful and provided great communication from the moment we booked his apartment until we got home. Increasingly accommodating and helpful, Remy has helped make my trip a true joy. 

The apartment is clean and is in a good location. While not on the central district it is do close that only a couple minutes will get you there from the tram or bus right out the front door. Easy walking distance to vondlepark and the grocery store and bakery are less than a minute away. 

This is my 8th trip to Amsterdam and staying at rents house is probably the best place I have stayed at. I highly recommend it. 

If every airbnb experience was this great I don't know how hotels could stay in business. 

Thanks Remy!"
3301556;26056104;2015-02-02;7879009;Nicole;Wonderful time at Remy's! His apartment is cozy, well located, clean and spacious. The décor is romantic with classical music and antiques. Would highly recommend!

793499;5776922;2013-07-15;7379063;Eléonore;A great and really comfy place in a quiet neighbourhood not so far from the center.  We had a great view from the balcony ! We enjoyed the decoration that created a pleasant atmosphere.  Anne was really friendly and gave us good tips about restaurants and accommodation.
793499;14706367;2014-06-24;16272902;Yuri;"I and my girlfriend spent 3 days in Amsterdam in this apartment. It's probably typical Amsterdam housing, we liked it, there is some charm in it. 

Though this is not the center, everything is easily reachable by public transport: the museumkwartier, the center of the city. Vondelpark is within a walking distance, and it is a very nice park.

The host provided us with a very detailed explanation of how to use Park & Ride, but if we had decided to park next to the house, there were  enough parking spots all the time.

The Albert Heijn supermarket is very close, and for the adventurous souls there is a local coffee shop just around the corner :)"
793499;81689405;2016-06-24;17149313;Hristo;"We didn't have the chance to meet our host in person, since we has away. His housekeeper received us at the apartment on the arrenged time and explained us briefly about the house (very nice person)

Christiaan was available at every moment answearing emails when we needed to contact with him (he was also available by phone, but we didn't get a local SIM card to make calls).

Everything in the apartment during our stay was great (notable mention to the very comfortable bed in the bedroom ;)). In the nearbys there is a super-market and a tram stop which can get you to the city centre in no-time! 

In summary: Christiaan is a great host! He had everything prepared for us upon our arrival (such as instructions for the TV remote, the heating system, etc). I can definitely recomend Christiaan's place if you plan on visiting Amsterdam!"
10562065;112119433;2016-11-04;40049818;Nicole;"It is a nice appartment, situated very well in a calm street with 3 minutes to walk to the Rembrandt Plein. There you find restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarket and so on.

Our host was very friendly, the appartment was really nice with an amazing view."

We have stayed there for 2 weeks and we are completely satisfied. Thank you Karin!"
907742;73653033;2016-05-09;33346303;Serene;Karin was a great host! She gave clear details of how to go to her house. Although we didn't get to meet her as she was away, she kindly asked her friend to show us around the house and made sure we knew everything us. She also texted me regularly to check on how everything is going. She replies promptly to any queries we have also. I recommend staying here! Her house is super beautiful and clean as well. I love it!

469350;38267413;2015-07-14;26775976;Sarah;Carla's apartment was perfect for our trip, a really comfortable, open and light space for six of us. Great location, quiet but close enough to walk everywhere. I wasn't there to check in but Carla was happy to meet the rest of the group.
469350;43221573;2015-08-18;26375145;Omar;(6 guys from london) We arrived and we're met within 10 mins by Ben a friend of Carla's. The area is really quiet and calm, really easy to walk into the city. The apartment is clean and great for a close group. All amenities were provided and Carla had WiFi password, taxi numbers and suggested supermarkets written down for us in the apartment when we arrived. Really nice place, everyone loved it. Thanks Carla!

469350;113099971;2016-11-10;81994321;Kevin;Apartment was absolutely beautiful and in such a lovely neighbourhood. It is close to many amenities (groceries, restaurants, shops, etc.) and quite close to the central station as well. The apartment itself is nice and open and very conducive to late night chats, games, etc. We really enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone!
7870530;48411006;2015-09-26;41293474;Bryce;Great stay! Easy to get to the city centre using the bus 22 or 48. Nice little gift on arrival. A very clean and tidy apartment. I recommend it fully.

6375750;58307407;2016-01-02;13199773;Victoria;"We totally loved Celina's apartment! The house is the perfect size for a couple or a single person and it's really cozy. We specially liked the natural light that it had all day, and the balcony.
The apartment is exactly like in the photos, no surprises. 
The gas heater was very easy to use and the fact that there was no microwave wasn't a problem, you could have the water boiling in a minute!
There's no TV but who needs that.
The apartment is on a third floor with no elevator, and the stairs are a bit narrow, so if you have a big suitcase you'll need to take your time.
The location is really nice, less than 15 min away by tram from the Dam and  10 min walking to the Park. We also went walking yo the Van Gogh Museum and it took us less than 30 min. From the airport is really easy to get there and less that 30 min.
The neighbourhood is nice too, with less tourists than the Center but still busy, the Ten Katemaark is perfect to buy some fruits or cheese.
It took us a bit longer to find a supermarket to buy the basic stuff, but it is there.
Celina is a wonderful host, she gave us the instructions of the house (but as she said, everything speaked for itself), she gave us instructions on how to get there from the airport. The apartment was very clean and everything was ready to use. We didn't have the need to contact her during our stay and she was very flexible with the check in and out time.
I would absolutely recomend this apartment."
6375750;93076139;2016-08-11;63459770;Christian;We had a wonderful time in Celina's apartment! It is really cosy and Celina is a perfect host. Thank you! Highly recommended!
7435471;73368294;2016-05-08;69920508;Divna;we had a beautifull stay at Vidar's flat, so full of light, spacious and fonctionnal,  in a very quite street and close to shops, even a baker and a butcher, ... and especially close to good terrasses! (bars and restaurants) in the JOrdaan (my favourite area in Amsterdam), very close to the center (3mn with bikes!) We could park our bikes in front of the flat, the street is really safe. Vidar was very reactiv by replying to my messages and questions . Thanks a lot to him :-) I definitly recommand
7435471;124974355;2017-01-03;14126423;Victor;"It was our first time in Amsterdam and our flight in from Heathrow was delayed. Since it was New Year's Eve and we didn't arrive till 10:00 PM, Vidar was still able to meet us at the apartment and provide us with the keys and show us around. 

He was very gracious and accommodating. And the apartment itself was pretty awesome. We had an awesome start to 2017 at Vidar's AirBNB!"
558721;2512077;2012-10-05;3319579;Kyle;Gil was an awesome host, he gave me his phone number. and made sure it was easy for me to get a hold and contact him for emergency's. Right away i knew gil was the right host for me due to his very fast response rate. When i arrived gil greeted me with great respect and showed me around the apt. the apt is perfect for 1 person a bed and shirt/jacket rack, some bookshelves with some books :) outlets for computer  a comfy chair and free wireless internet. room is a nice size. Me and gil had a lot of great conversations. After talking to gil the first day i knew that i had stumbled upon the right guy his attitude and poise just sends really Good vibes- perhaps due to his love and appreciation for the Buddha philosophy. gil is a really talented musician just ask to listen to some of his music and you'll see what i mean.   the Location is quiet just like the add says and remarkably right across the street is a raw food store, organic produce and yoga loft- literately just a few steps away. i couldnt ask for a better place to stay thx gil
558721;3074352;2012-12-11;2074359;Aaron;I had a wonderful stay in Gil's apartment in De  Pijp. The location truly  is wonderful (close to the center, but certainly not crazy tourist central), and the room is exactly as it appears in the photos. It gets great light, and feels very private, being up at the front of the flat. Gil's directions to the from the airport were flawless, and he was very helpful, friendly, social, and always available when I was in a pinch. The apartment really is the perfect place for a solo traveler to lay down their head while in Amsterdam, and Gil was a wonderful host.
558721;3158837;2012-12-26;2007866;Joey;"I must say that this property he's been my best experience yet on Airbnb.
Gil's flat in De Pijp is exactly how it is described and pictured. It's is the perfect place to stay while traveling around Amsterdam, in a great neighborhood that is walking distance to cafes, bars, the gracery store, and many other places including the daily farmers/flea market. It is really easy to get to from the train station and is about a 10-15 minute walk to the touristy parts such as Dam Square. The area ""De Pijp"" where the flat is located is a really cool area. I plan on returning here this Summer but for a month, not only to visit this wonderful city but to visit my new friend Gil"
558721;3556036;2013-02-16;4867127;Jakkrit;"My stay with Gil was simply perfect and what a lovely apartment and great hospitality he has! The room was so spacious and cozy it makes you easily feel like home in a foreign city. Amsterdam's most famous outdoor market on ""Albert Cuypstraat"" is in 5-minute reach and access to several tram lines are just around the corner. Most importantly, opportunities to uncover cool, hidden spots and get to know great people in Amsterdam under Gil's guidance was priceless and if only I could have stayed longer! 

In short, highly recommended!!"
558721;4171587;2013-04-15;4603790;Patricio;Gil was a great host, always available to any doubt and really concern about your stay. Besides the room is really big and the location is great. Thanks Gil!
558721;4763952;2013-05-24;5778068;Yash;My stay at Gil's was very comfortable. The room is spacious and resourceful. Gil is very kind and thoughtful host. Also the neighborhood is just great with all possible connections and various shops. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
558721;6166813;2013-08-01;1633573;Claire;I rented this flat for a friend of mine and i know for sure he enjoyed his stay  !!! thanks for everything !
558721;7116315;2013-09-07;7650919;Carol;Gil lives in a great section of Amsterdam - close to many fine restaurants and pastry shops, and many convenient to the tram.  Getting about Amsterdam (if you are not on a bicycle) is best by tram.  They are extremely convenient. Gil is located near a tram that takes you quickly to the museum area - the Van Gogh, Rijsmuseum, Museum of Modern Art, and the Concertgebouw were just a few minutes away.  Gil was extremely helpful, always smiling and pleasant, and patiently answered my many questions.  He is a jazz musician (piano) and i am a classical musician (piano, organ, harpsichord), so we talked until late many nights about music - a huge plus for me.  Very nice room - He could not have been more helpful and generous.
558721;8353650;2013-10-27;3859062;Marton;Gil is a great host! As he spent all his life in Amsterdam he can give you tips where to go in the city. The location is also very comfortable as the tram stop is a few minutes walking distance from the app. I highly recommend Gils place!
558721;10662346;2014-03-02;11710090;Dan;First of all, Amsterdam is fantastic! I am a solo traveler and Gil had everything I needed. He is incredibly friendly, warm, and nonjudgmental. His flat is in a perfect location. Not directly in the center of it all which makes for great walks to the sites. The place is ground floor, which I have no problem with but some might. The flat itself is a bit older, so it shoes character. I wouldn't recommend it to the posh. But for a solo traveler it is perfect. Simplicity and warmth. Everything you need. You will be treated like a friend more than a guest which I love. There will often be music playing in the flat so if you're not open to comradire you may find some restless moments. You get what you pay for here. Everything you need and nothing you don't. I highly recommend it. I hope to make another visit with Gil soon.
558721;11955799;2014-04-20;11968857;Catherine;I had a great time staying at Gil's apartment for 4 nights.  The location is convenience,  just 10 mins from amsterdam centraal by tram no. 4 and 5 mins walk and have nice restaurant and cafe nearby.  ( one of the cafe just 5 mins walk from his home is really nice,  i had to re-visit the cafe after i tried once).  Gil is friendly and helpful,  he would chat with you everytime we met and would recommend things to do in amsterdam if you have no idea. Would recommend you to stay.
558721;15465732;2014-07-09;9314242;Simon;Gil is a great host. He was flexible about arrival times, and when there was some work done on the room he was very clear with his communication and accommodating. The apartment is fantastic - great location, lots of light, stylishly decorated. A perfect getaway amid the bustle of Amsterdam.
558721;16720763;2014-08-01;16837044;Eki;Great place to stay and friendly host too. Unfortunately I only stayed for a short time but definitely will come to visit Amsterdam again and stay there.
558721;17364010;2014-08-11;16308247;Erebus;"Gil is a young musician. His place is located in the De Pijp district, Amsterdam's ""Latin quarter"". It is 20 min tram-trip plus 5-min walk from the Central Station, 15 min tram to the ""Museum Quarter"". In a word, close enough to major attractions but far enough to enjoy a quiet and good neighborhood. I felt safe even returning at midnight. De Pijp in itself is an interesting district to explore. Gil's home is not far away from the mile-long Albert Cuypmarkt where, more than just a tourist attraction, you can get everything you need. 

Gil's place is where he lives. Don't expect luxury and fancy decoration. However it is cozy enough to feel at home.

The room is spacious and comfortable. The only problem may be it is on the ground floor. You have to draw the curtain to enjoy total privacy. As it is a quiet area, not many passers-by actually. However if you desperately need sunlight and absolute privacy at the same time, you have to think twice. My only complain is instead there is no window. Sometimes I do hope to enjoy some fresh air at night. But in Amsterdam, open window seems to be a strange existence.

Gil has very nice personality and is very helpful. He is considerate and tries to make your stay comfortable and homey. I enjoyed staying in Gil's place when exploring Amsterdam's much beloved urban vibe."
558721;18655912;2014-08-30;17324194;Guglielmo;I stayed in Gil's place for a few days while attending a conference. I met him on my first day there and we actually didn't have the chance to see each other again! Neverhteless Gil was very friendly and I found his place quite nice. The room and the whole flat were very cozy, comfortable, clean and quiet, even though on the ground floor! The neighborhood is indeed quite lively, full of nice cafes and bars but that street in particular happens to be a very little traficated one, so best of both worlds!  It's relatively easy to reach the place from the central station with the public transportation and it was an ideal hq for me to both comply with the conference schedule and get to know Amsterdam a little better in the evening. In summary, it was a very nice stay!
558721;19794202;2014-09-18;20879429;Gerhard;"Very nice and quiet room. It was perfectly located for my conference at RAI and the downtown area, everything in walking distance.
Gil is a very nice host, who tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible and you get all the privacy you need.

I will definitely consider this place again, when I will come back to Amsterdam for the next conference."
558721;30555995;2015-04-24;11847280;Victor;Great experience with Gil. Although I had minimal contact with him, when I did, he was very accommodating and friendly. Place was clean and had plenty of room for my luggage. I wouldn't mind booking another stay at Gil's place during my next stay in Amsterdam.
558721;32461844;2015-05-18;11315963;James;What a wonderful stay!!  Gil was very friendly and his hospitality makes you feel at home.  Close to everything you could need!

558721;35741504;2015-06-21;2196008;Diego;I spent two night in Gil's place. It is in a quite neighborhood. The room was clean, spacious and peaceful, at street level. I didn’t meet Gil in person since he was playing music out of the country, but the communication before my arrival was fine. Also his friend Barbara that opened up for me was nice. Recommended!
558721;47257903;2015-09-17;32812936;Fran;"Very nice home, perfect room, great location, and very nice guy.
I would be back to Gil's house for sure.

Ich komme wieder.
Vielen Dank!"
558721;50951042;2015-10-16;35773005;Pietro;Gil is amazing and his apartment is delicious! super recommended!
558721;55583296;2015-12-02;27883886;Martin;Gil is a very nice and warm person and is helpful for those new in town. It was nice staying at his place, the location is great, good neighbourhood with some nice restaurants, it's very close to the Museumsquarter for instance. The place is lovely. You share a bathroom and a kitchen with Gil. Recommend.
558721;56398601;2015-12-13;12406930;Stace;"Gil was a great host, he was very flexible with the check-in time, as I arrived early which allowed me to retrieve the key and drop off some heavy items out of my backpack so I could explore the city.  Gil is a friendly, trustworthy and a busy guy, as he had a couple of gigs lined up on the weekend I was there, so I basically had the place to myself.

The accommodations worked for what I needed, as I don't spend much time indoors other than to sleep, so what you see in the pictures is what you get. 

The location was what I was exactly looking for, I wanted to be just outside Centrum and close enough to the museums. I like to blend in as a local, so utilize public transit to blend in like a local. Staying in De Pijp was ideal, not knowing in advance, but the location was extremely close to the tram which I often used.  Remember to buy a 1-3 day pass at the airport to utilize the outstanding public transit system in Amsterdam.

The the three things I look for in an Airbnb place, location, price and positive reviews, Gil's place had it all, I recommend this place to the users reading this review."
558721;60762831;2016-01-27;50483688;Jesse;"Staying at Gils place was a great experience. The room is as big as the pictures indicate (if not bigger) with plenty of room to relax in privacy.
Gil was really welcoming and provided everything I needed without having to ask for it.
His place is in a great location close to really great eating places, cafes and public transport.
Highly recommend choosing to stay with Gil in Amsterdam"

558721;87392443;2016-07-19;14657804;Glenn;Gil's room is just as comfortable as it was when I stayed last year. Even in high summer the room was quite cool. This visit I explored the neighborhood at little more.  Nice local park , coffeeshops and places to eat.
558721;120673561;2016-12-11;94002504;Adam;Extremely helpful and understanding. You can't beat the location if you are looking for a more authentic feel of Amsterdam.

Das Zimmer war sauber und das Bett sehr gemütlich. Die Wohnung liegt super zentral in einer tollen lebendigen Gegend. Aber nachts hört man nichts im Schlafzimmer. Es ist sehr ruhig zum schlagen!"

2477880;20451311;2014-09-29;5937153;Ana;"El apartamento está muy bien situado, cerca del centro pero a la vez apartado de la vida nocturna de Amsterdam. 
Jan es muy agradable, tiene muy buen gusto, muestra de ello es la decoración del interior del apartamento y la máquina de paintball en el salón que es un puntazo!! Da mucho juego a altas horas de la noche, aunque Jan es un jugador con mucha práctica. 
Los tres días que estuvimos en su casa, nos hizo sentirnos como en la nuestra, fue realmente hospitalario y sin duda la casa muy limpia y ordenada. Me habría gustado hablar más con él pero además de la limitación del idioma, no estuvimos apenas en el apartamento porque nos hizo un tiempo estupendo.
Gracias por todo Jan!!"
2477880;30213741;2015-04-19;18443579;Claudia;Jan-Tjalling was super gastvrij en het verblijf was aangenaam. Heerlijk bed en mooie badkamer en de locatie is echt TOP!

2477880;41433346;2015-08-07;33769250;Sarmen;Jan was very welcoming and friendly. He even took the time to give me a tour of the city. His place is clean, comfortable, and most importantly, perfectly located. You can reach most worthwhile sights on foot. I can only recommend staying at Jan's place.
2477880;47727808;2015-09-21;31120108;Pancho;Die Lage ist natürlich sehr sehr gut, der Gastgeber freundlich und immer für eine Information gut. Das Zimmer sah aus wie auf dem Foto. Alles prima, danke.
2477880;54348761;2015-11-18;48493427;Daniel;Had a great time staying with Jan at his apartment. The location is great for seeing whatever brings you to Amsterdam and Jan is very good at making you feel comfortable at his home. The place itself is beautiful and I'd be honoured to stay here again. I recommend asking Jan about some of the history of the area and great things to do for your visit.
2477880;65838589;2016-03-17;2782141;Neil;Great spot for a short visit to Amsterdam.  Jan's apartment is newly renovated with great taste and Dutch efficiency.  The neighborhood is extremely convenient to walk to Jordaan and enough away from the tourists for quiet nights.
2477880;96471179;2016-08-23;75462983;Igor;L'accoglienza nella casa è stata ottima, senza problemi. Appena arrivati ci ha mostrato le cose più importanti per poterci arrangiare durante il soggiorno, pohe cose ma utili. La casa è la fedele riproduzione delle foto, quindi davvero bella. Il quartiere è davvero tranquillo ma a pochi dalla night life. Ottimo soggiorno e ottimo Host

2477880;139188992;2017-03-24;101880642;Patty;"Jan is very friendly and knowledgeable regarding all the local spots rich in history. If you're looking for a ""tour guide"" or to go solo and explore, he's very adaptable to either. My room was perfectly sized, and can sleep 3 if needed. His home is located close to public transport if you don't want to walk. I suggest walking as most everything is no more than a 30 minute walk and it gives you a chance to see the architecture and all of the shops."

13440949;90631016;2016-08-01;64648458;Maxime;Taeke and Mark's appartment is just perfect. Confortable and cosy. We really liked the place. Near the centerof amsterdam. And they helped us to find good places to eat. Really nice. Sad to not see them.
3073208;69460044;2016-04-11;22497912;Alexander;Great Appartment, very well-equiped and a great atmosphere. The rooftop is a dream and you can relax with a beautiful view over the city. You can walk in 10 minutes to the city center, or use the tram 100 meters away. The neighboorhood owns a lot of bars and restaurants. We stayed for two nights with 4 persons and everything was perfect. The second sleeping room is small but the bed is comfortable for a couple!  Thanks for the cold welcome beer:-) We can recommend this place...
3073208;79712326;2016-06-13;6071352;Anaïs;"Very nice apartment, well located (close to the tram and various grocery shops) and at 15min biking distance from the city center.
We loved the Scandinavian style and the rooftop! During summer it should be very enjoyable.
Only remarks I have are about the stairs and the second bed. Be aware that there are lots of stairs to access the apartment (and then to the rooftop) and this might not be convenient for all people.
The second bed is quite tiny and according to me it's more appropriate for one person only.
Thomas was a kind host, answering all questions and with cool conditions. His friend Marius was also very nice.
I recommend this place for a great stay in Amsterdam!"
1958574;28849009;2015-03-30;6361322;Claire;Magne and Marien were very helpful and super responsive, and worked out a way for us to meet despite a city wide power cut (thanks again!). The studio is basic but has everything you need, and it's easy to get across to the city centre on the free ferry.
1958574;66909227;2016-03-25;24323218;Florie;"I really enjoyed my stay in Magne's apartment. Magne was very nice and welcoming, she picked me up at the ferry stop in Central Station and then showed me the apartment. She stayed available for any questions or demand the whole time I was in Amsterdam. 
The apartment was very comfortable, luminous and located in a quiet neighbourhood, north Central station. It is perfect for those who wants to be close to the city but out of the crowd! There are nice parks and groceries close by. It is a 4 min walk from the free ferry that takes you to Central station. The ferry stops running after midnight, but there is another ferry that runs all night that is just a little further form the apartment (about 10 min walk).
I would highly recommend it! Thank you Magne! :-)"
12804908;74241722;2016-05-14;37394277;Alvin;"If you are looking for a nice, clean and CENTRAL place, I can only recommend you to stay at Santi and Adindas place!
Here's why:
1. I cannot emphasise enough how central this apartmen is located (5min to Leidseplein) and it has an Albert Hein literally next door.
2. The hosts, Santi and Adinda, are a lovely couple. Unfortunately, we haven't seen each other much, but they made sure that we felt welcomed. The apartment was clean and smelled like freshly baked pastry every day!"
12804908;74656899;2016-05-16;45532355;Melodie;"Super séjour cher Santi et Adinda qui sont des hôtes à la fois discrets et disponibles! La chambre est d'un confort remarquable, de même que le reste de l'appartement, qui est idéalement situé (à quelques pas du centre, des quartiers branchés mais aussi moins touristiques). 
Nous recommandons vivement!"
12804908;82954415;2016-06-30;52234450;Manuel;Santiago muy amable y atento en todo momento la estancia con ellos es muy simple ya que son personas muy prácticas, respetuosas y accesibles. El departamento se encuentra muy bien ubicado y es tal cual lo describe la fotografía, limpio y espacioso. También tienen un detalles muy agradables Como agua y chocolate en la habitación.
49790;1349618;2012-05-26;1745784;David;This was our first experience with Airbnb and therefore did not really know exactly what to expect.  But Klaas' houseboat was perfect!  The location on the end of the canal was quiet and peaceful.  The houseboat itself was first class all the way and has absolutely every amenity that you could ask for.  The pictures do not actually do it justice as the place looks even better in person.  The shower is one of the best and biggest I have ever seen.  Everything you could possibly want to do is walking distance from the house.  The train station is around the corner and we used that frequently for the 10 minute ride into the city center.  Klaas is the nicest guy you could ever want as a host.  Communication was never a problem.  He has a very nice boat docked right next to the houseboat that we had a private canal tour on that was probably the highlight of the entire trip.  I looked at so many places to stay in Amsterdam that my head was spinning trying to decide.  But I made the right choice and would not stay anywhere else.  I cannot say enough great things to say about this place.  You will not be disappointed if you stay here.  We are recommending this houseboat to all of our friends and will stay here in the future when we return to Amsterdam.  The 3 nights we stayed here were just not enough.  Please quit looking at other places and stay here.
49790;1970836;2012-08-13;2944555;Daniele;"My stay at Klaas's houseboat was intended to be a special present for my wife's birthday... And it ended up being one of our best weekends ever! The houseboat is simply perfect, beautiful and very well equipped, and the neighbourhood is quite and very beautiful. Everything was even better than I expected.

Klaas was indeed a great host, he welcomed us warmly and he provided us with very valuable indications about where to have dinner, how to get to center, etc. He also had a super ""mini bar"" at the houseboat, with very special wines at great prices. It seems to me that Klaas really enjoys providing a wonderful experience to his guests, you can tell that by the quality and care you can find in everything in the houseboat, from furniture to drinks.

I will repeat the experience for sure."
49790;2053928;2012-08-21;2818858;Sherry;"Klaas was great and let us book a tour with him on his boat as an extra - it was a fabulous way to see parts of Amsterdam and the nearby communities from the water. Very special!
Being on a house boat is a great attraction especially in a city like Amsterdam that has a network of canals and buildings that face the waterways. We felt a part of the city in a way that wouldn't be possible in a regular house or hotel. 
The house boat location is very convenient to visit all of downtown Amsterdam, yet feels quiet and relaxing when you need to rest. 
We used the bicycles there for a day long tour through the countryside as well as to ride around town. 
Klaas also had a friend meet us to coordinate keys and that worked out well. 
Overall a very memorable and fun trip for us!"
49790;4990038;2013-06-05;3861077;Suladda;"We love our stay at Klaas boat house very much. We admire your taste . Thanks again for sharing your home.

The house is at a quiet end of amsterdam. Peaceful and private. The place is clean and cared for. A 15 mins walk to town let you see the city in a bigger picture and stay away from busy center.

A walk through Vondelpark nearby will show you how the local enjoy their day. Many tasty restaurant all around. Convevient in everyway.Truely a lovely area.

Klaas is a great host. Very relax and kind. Always there when you need help.

We love amsterdam and Klaas's house boat is a part of it. Will sure return when we get a chance."

Klaas is an excellent Host and always makes you welcome. Communication is also excellent

I would recommend anyone to stay"

49790;32318280;2015-05-17;27280468;Verena;"Wir hatten eine wunderbare Zeit auf dem Hausboot und haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Alles was man braucht war da - und noch viel mehr. Das Hausboot ist geräumig und äußerst geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Auf der Terrasse kann man abends herrlich in der Sonne sitzen; wir hatten Sekt mitgenommen und dort auf unseren Kurzurlaub angestoßen - wunderbar. 
Der Empfang war sehr nett, alles wurde geduldig erklärt; das war wegen der vielen technischen Apparaturen (Jalousien, Licht, Fernseher mit verschiedenen Fernbedienungen etc.) auch nötig. Daher mein Tipp: Hierfür ein bisschen Zeit einplanen und Notizen machen. Es gibt auch einen CD-Player, also ggf. CDs mitnehmen oder auch die Möglichkeit seine Musik auf dem smart phone über blue tooth laufen zu lassen.  
Die Umgebung ist sehr angenehm und bietet viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten für Lebensmittel (z. B. ein Bioladen) sowie Cafés. Alles war sauber und ordentlich. Wenn man extrem pingelig ist, hätte man hier und da vielleicht noch einen Krümel gefunden - sind wir aber nicht. 
Für Leute, die gerne auf einer eher härteren Matratze schlafen (so wie ich) ist das große Bett im Schlafzimmer zu weich - keine Kritik, weil da ist ja jeder anders, sollte man nur wissen.
Alles in allem waren wir glücklich und zufrieden."
49790;36376242;2015-06-28;2898942;Michael;"Welcomed in a lovely houseboat with beers in the fridge, good wine collection at fair price and coffee.
Boat was exactly as described down to the small details.
Cozy naborhood with nice restaurants and cafes close by and easy connection to center city with tram just 500m away.
In total a very good experience we can only recommend and not unlike we return."

She always responded quickly, was very helpful and accommodating to our crazy flight schedules, and welcomed us into her beautiful home with open arms. Two old school friends and I had a mini reunion over a weekend, and the room was a perfect base for our various outings into the city.

The whole family seemed very relaxed, and the house was very tidy and cosy. The beds were comfortable, and my only complaint would be that I didn't get to stay long enough. Thank you for having us!"
5475024;57101365;2015-12-21;33598527;Sacha;When I arrived in Jasmijn's house, she welcomes me warmely and makes me visiting the house. She explains me quietely how to go in the city with maps and timetables. I explained Jasmijn that I was surprised that the house was located in Jordaan district on the Airbnb website (bug?), but anyway 20 mn are enough to join downtown by metro. I thank Jasmijn and her family for her warm welcome!
5475024;57773713;2015-12-29;7786631;Zoubida;Jasmin and her husband were  very kind and hopeful , they answered all my questions , always with a smile. The room  is very clean and quiet.

Så mycket bättre än ett tråkigt hotellrum. Jochem och hans lilla familj har en mycket smakfullt inredd lägenhet med allt du behöver. Den har en härlig balkong in mot gården.
Precis utanför är en livlig gata med butiker och en spårvagnshållplats. Det finns också många trevliga restauranger precis runt hörnet. Som värdar visade de sig vara mycket vänliga, flexibla, hjälpsamma och generösa.
Vi rekommenderar starkt både lägenhet och värdar."

I didn't get to meet Stephanie but her boyfriend helped me moving in. They were really nice and very easy to reach. The only downside is that the apartment doesn't have an elevator so there are a lot of stairs. Overall I highly recommend it!

Laura and Marnix are very kind and caring hosts, and we thank them for this great week!"

Perfect size, extremely clean, small touches like eye masks/ slippers etc made it feel like we were staying in a hotel..... lovely furniture and comfy bed..... the little kitchen area was all we needed. Lovely big balcony. Modern clean bathroom with all amenities. They made us feel extremely welcome and gave us all the advice and info we needed. We walked 20 mins into town each day down the canal... They even gave us a little sweet treat as a leaving present. We will definitely go back.... A wonderful trip and perfect apartment!

16747898;136717329;2017-03-12;107017843;Katie;This location was in a great place right outside the city center.  My friend and I were a little uncomfortable with the check in process due to Zander's friend checking us in instead of him. His friend did not show us around the house or apartment area so we had to figure it out by ourselves. There was also no communication with Zander during our trip. Overall the apartment was great, just a little dusty.

11855399;67996343;2016-04-01;55373550;Daniel;Not a very good experience! When we arrived the apartment wasn't clean and was messy - the hoover was left in the living room, there was a basket with dirty laundry in one of the bedrooms and the fridge was full of the owner's stuff. Bed linen in both bedrooms seemed to be used before our arrival, it was really old and even ripped. It was obvious that it was a living apartment which wasn't prepared at all prior to paying customer's arrival. We called the owner to complain and within a couple of hours he delivered new bed linen, which partly resolved the problem however my wife had to clean the kitchen and the bathroom in the meantime just to feel semi-comfortable to stay there. I would not stay there again as what you see on the pictures is not what you get in reality! Very disappointing indeed!

The apartment is in a traditional house of the center, very nice small building and the owners managed to arrange it in a very nice place, and to setup a small but functional bathroom.

Denise was nice and always reactive, although we had some delays on the trip she managed to find a solution for the keys in minutes. We would definitely come back there next time!"

We arrived early and Maaike was great at organising an early check in so we could get rid of our bags and start exploring. Also organising balloons and a bottle of bubbly for his special birthday, such a lovely touch. 
The apartment is in a great location, just outside the centre and lovely and quiet in the evenings. It was very clean and beautifully presented. (Maaike has great taste!) everything you could need for your stay is provided and being able to use the washing machine was a plus. 
This is a really great base for exploring the wonderful city of Amsterdam. Thank you so much Maaike :-)"

L'appartement fait 80 m² et est situé à 2 pas d'un arrêt de bus et à 25 minutes de marche d'un ferry qui nous emmène gratuitement jusqu'à la station d'Amsterdam. L'appartement est à 5 minutes à pieds d'un Liddl pour les courses et le pain. Il n'est pas très loin non plus d'une station service et de l'autoroute qui permet de rejoindre de nombreuses autres villes. Le parking est très pratique pour y garer sa voiture. L'appartement se situe dans un endroit calme et en bordure d'une rivière et d'un grand espace vert où il est bon se promener.
Les quelques inconvénients rencontrés : La décoration n'est pas terrible et mériterait quelques travaux. L'appartement sentait la cigarette. Le lave-vaisselle ne fonctionnait pas. Pas de sèche-cheveux.
Mais dans l'ensemble, c'était quand même très bien."
4961851;34552429;2015-06-09;29284828;Arthur;"Appartement très spacieux dans un quartier très calme, proche d'une rivière relaxante. Petit commerce à proximité. L'appartement est également juste à coté d'un arrêt de bus qui permet d'atteindre le centre ville en 15 minutes sans aucun problèmes. 
Très bon accueil de l'hôte avec une présentation des alentours précises.
Vivement recommandé, rien à redire, c'est parfait !"
4961851;39159278;2015-07-21;31786955;Monica;"La casa è a 10 minuti in bus dal centro di Amsterdam, e la fermata del bus è proprio attaccata alla casa.. L'appartamento molto confortevole e ampio, in quattro persone era perfetto. La zona è molto tranquilla e c'è un piccolo market a 5 minuti per poter comprare le cose essenziali. Benjiamin purtroppo non siamo riusciti a conoscerlo personalmente ma è stato molto gentile quando abbiamo avuto bisogno di lui tramite telefono. 
Spero che nel mio prossimo viaggio ad Amsterdam questo appartamento sarà ancora disponibile :)"
4961851;39490695;2015-07-24;31004219;Katherine;Apartment was spacious and clean, light & airy. We were met by Benjamin's friend who was early, very helpful and friendly. To be honest, although only about a 15 minute on the bus (so reasonably close) it did feel quite a long way from everything in the tourist area. Quiet part of town.
4961851;49008469;2015-09-30;39994553;Mario;"El apartamento está muy bien, limpio y con mucha iluminación, y cuenta con todo lo necesario para pasar unos días cómodamente. Perfecto para 4 personas, o incluso 5 si algún día esperáis algún invitado más. Situado en un barrio supertranquilo, con una para de bus justo al lado que te deja en el centro en 10min.

Benjamin es un gran anfitrión. Aunque no lo conocimos en persona, un amigo suyo vino a abrirnos el piso, y no hemos tenido ningún problema con él cuando hemos hablado por airbnb.

Recomendado 100% para pasar unos días en Ámsterdam, ¡nosotros esperamos volver más pronto que tarde!"
4961851;55936210;2015-12-07;32734047;Marina;"Perfect!
The house was very beautiful e confortable..full of everything you need..the bus stop was very closed, 1 minute to reach it.
Benjamin was very kind.
Definetly a very good place to stay in Amsterdam.."
4961851;78684884;2016-06-08;64565075;Leo;I've had a wonderful stay at Benjamin's apartment. Beautiful place in a good location. Far from the city center but it had a great bike path with wonderful scenery if you are looking to see Amsterdam from a different perspective. I would definitely stay again!
4961851;85845839;2016-07-13;57774840;Malen;El piso esta correcto, el acceso a la ciudad es lo mejor ...
4961851;105299797;2016-10-01;66434332;Matteo;Benjamin was very cozy! his flat is very spacious with all the confort we needed and in a very quiet area! my friend and i spent a very good time in his apartment ! it's also enough easy to arrive in the town center!
2891805;18115688;2014-08-22;15768190;Marco;"L'accoglienza di Esther è stata ottima, ci ha fornito indicazioni precise e dettagliate per raggiungere l'appartamento dall'aeroporto, e ci ha accolto al momento del nostro arrivo per fornirci alcune utili indicazioni sull'appartamento, il quartiere e la città. 
Lo spazio è davvero accogliente e ti fa sentire immediatamente a tuo agio, e  inoltre mette a disposizione tutto ciò che può servire per trascorrervi alcuni giorni in maniera davvero confortevole. 
Oltretutto è collocato in un quartiere residenziale affascinante, ma è altrettanto silenzioso e tranquillo come davvero non ci aspettavamo. 
Lo consiglio a chiunque per l'estrema praticità, pulizia, e ottimo gusto. 
Grazie davvero ad Esther perchè è un'ospite veramente con i fiocchi !"
2891805;19686695;2014-09-16;14900643;Venetia;Esther was a great host. Her and her boyfriend were there to meet us and left us some travel cards and some suggestions of fun things to do. The flat was lovely. Comfortable and cute with a lovely garden area at the back. The area was perfect as it was nice and quiet but half an hour walk to most central places. Would definitely recommend this flat :)
2891805;46869873;2015-09-14;16623875;Earl;"Esther and Boris's home is really beautiful and is everything they mentioned and described and the both of them are so nice. They took the time to welcome us to their home and explained everything in detail to us.  They even provided us with the OV chip card for local busses and trams travel. 

The location is good,  in a quiet neighbourhood,  with access to bus,  just right outside with a short 3 minute walk. There is also an Albert supermarket if you stop one bust stop before the one to their home. 

Will be back again for sure if we are headed to Amsterdam again and will recommend to friends as well."
13144755;100342730;2016-09-08;70060774;Katie;"We stayed here for a week with our 10 month old daughter, and the stay could not have been better. The apartment is lovely--tidy and bright and clean. Kathleen was extremely accommodating and even purchased a travel crib for our use during the stay. The bedroom is a bit small, so we had our daughter sleep in the living room and we would hang out in the bedroom in the evenings. Having a small kitchen was perfect so we could prepare easy breakfasts and pack up small meals for our daughter. It was also wonderful to have a washing machine in the apartment, which we used once.

The neighborhood is perfect--quiet, but with easy access to Vondelpark, grocery stores, drugstores, excellent coffee, and tons of restaurants. It is very close to a tram but we actually just walked everywhere during our stay. 

They even emailed ahead of time with information about how to get to the apartment from the airport (very easy by train/tram or by the #197 bus), and someone was there to greet us on arrival. 

Highly, highly recommended!"
13144755;116308271;2016-11-29;29446032;Eugen;The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13144755;125362862;2017-01-05;1206902;LeBrie;"We loved staying in Kathleen's apartment. It has a fantastic view of the canal, a small but well-equipped kitchen and cozy radiator heat. Loved the hardwood floors and the original artwork around the place. Would DEFINITELY stay here again on a future trip to Amsterdam. 

Note that the stairs are very steep (like many old canal houses in Amsterdam) - no problem for us, but anyone with mobility issues should be aware."
2763589;12572783;2014-05-05;14272546;Martella;Eine gastfreundliche Unterkunft mit einem liebevoll gemachten Frühstück. Ich kann es gerne weiterempfehlen!
2763589;13995056;2014-06-09;3475877;Jeff;"I had a fantastic stay in Amsterdam, thanks in large part to Erwin being such an amazing host.  He was really fantastic.  Besides being so kind, friendly and accommodating, he was very generous--he lent me an extra bike for my visit to ride around Amsterdam (along with lights for safety at night). On the first day gave me a bit of a bike tour into town.  He is very knowledgeable about Amsterdam and gave me great recommendations.  

The room was great--comfortable, cozy bed with bathroom and a lot of space.  The wifi was very fast.  I slept like a baby.  And the location is very nice and convenient for going into town.  Erwin was always available for help or suggestions on things to do, but also very respectful of my privacy.

And to top it all off, Erwin made me delicious breakfast in the morning.  I couldn't ask for a better host and a better place to stay in Amsterdam.  Thank you Erwin for making my visit so special!"
2763589;21323194;2014-10-14;22286715;Franziska;"You will feel welcomed every second of your stay here. Erwin is a great host, very helpful and supportive. Picked me up at the megabus-station, which is really close by, just on tram stop. Quiet neighbourhood, lovely and big room. Wonderful breakfast service. Very convenient connections to the city. 
I loved it."
2763589;26665386;2015-02-16;27690356;Clément;Really nice place and friendly host. Super easy way from the centraal station. Recommend.
2763589;81022916;2016-06-20;58289107;Joakim;"Allt var bra. Huset var väldigt intressant och trevligt. Erwin var på resande fot så hans dotter tog emot mig. Jag hyrde även cykel av dem, vilket så klart är billigare än att använda sig av en hyrfirma. 
Det går en spårvagn till centralen och en annan in till stan inom gångavstånd, för den som inte vill cykla. 
Området rut Zeeburg och IJhaven är klart värt att spana in och är rätt annorlunda från resten av Amsterdam. 
Jag är mycket nöjd."
2763589;90104364;2016-07-31;79596289;Luis;Erwin's hospitality was spectacular. I was greeted at home and gave me all the amenities needed. the room is on the ground floor of the house which gives you a lot of independence and tranquility, besides having equipped kitchen and private bathroom. I also leased a spectacular bicycle so there had to be found where. In addition to good host it is also an excellent tour guide. recommended 100%
2763589;120862693;2016-12-12;10518700;Aryan;I enjoyed my stay with Erwin . The accommodation was clean and Erwin had provided towels , wifi etc . Erwin was very friendly and was available to help me with anything I needed . Thanks for accommodating me on such short notice .
16301227;121630008;2016-12-18;77085315;Tessa;Zeer gastvrij en aardig. We hoefden de volgende dag niet op tijd weer de kamer uit want: 'je bent hier thuis, het is geen hotel'. Dat was heel fijn. Verder is de kamer simpel, maar dat vonden wij prima. Het centrum van Amsterdam is makkelijk te bereiken.
16301227;128888820;2017-01-28;104755153;Tim;Really pleasant and welcoming host.
16301227;130767679;2017-02-08;113821916;Justin;Wonderful wonderful host! Made us feel welcome the second we walked through the door! Place was clean and easy to find. Had a lovely time and would come back in an instant!
16301227;132725062;2017-02-19;34540532;Ayanna;B is such a great host.  Very warm and inviting.  Very accommodating for check in times.  Definitely recommend staying in her house!
16301227;134171202;2017-02-26;22026608;Julia;B was very nice and communicated well with us in how to get to her place and what to expect. She was very lenient in when we could come in and out of the place and was sweet by offering coffee or tea. Her place is nicely situated in a residential area but very close to the ferry that takes you to central station. In general it was very easy to arrive in Amsterdam central and get to her place. There are some cute cafes hidden around her place and a quick (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) search will reveal them. Very nice and made for a great stay.
4296384;26537965;2015-02-15;23425485;Eduardo;Paul is a fantastic guy, and his apartment is really nice and cosie. He was friendly and helpful, but at the same time gave us a lots of privacy. We plan to go back to Amsterdam in the summer and we'll definetely stay there!
4296384;26627825;2015-02-16;26894644;Kelsey;Paul was very welcoming and helpful. He told us all about the city and gave us museum passes so we could get in to most places for free! He gave us breakfast and left us water and chocolate in the room.
4296384;26755450;2015-02-18;27108947;Aurélien;Paul is very welcoming and we had a great time in Amsterdam. His apartment is very well located. Paul gave us bikes to get around in the city and it was very nice. One could also have a free pass museum that allowed us to visit museums free. I recommend Paul for his welcome and his kindness.
4296384;28798249;2015-03-30;23407968;Iphygenia;"Geweldig ontvangst door de buurman/broer. Fietsen/kaartjes metro, ter beschikking. Er werd goed voor ons gezorgd. En we hebben geslapen als een roos!
Zeker een aanrader! We komen deze zomer terug."
4296384;39265598;2015-07-22;8930814;Matija;Paul was a very kind and helpful host. He provided us with maps of the city and tickets for the public transport and museums. The room is small but still very cosy and above all, big enough to ensure a pleasant stay. His appartment is conveniently situated close to the metro station, which takes you to the city centre in minutes (it took us no more than 15 minutes to reach the city centre).
4296384;49979919;2015-10-08;20228465;Chiara;"Paul has been a special host! Really kind and helpful: we had a problem with a bike but he solved giving us his bike. He give us museum card, for free entrance in a lot of museum.
Well organised the kitchen and the breakfast... A really nice staying, we couldn't ask for more!"
4296384;50926844;2015-10-16;32334139;Christian;Die Wohnung ist sehr ruhig gelegen, dabei äußerst verkehrsgünstig: 5 Gehminuten zur Metro, mit dem Fahrrad ist man in 15 Minuten in der City. Die Wohnung ist hübsch eingerichtet, die Küche und die Sanitärräume sind eher klein, aber ausreichend. Paul ist ein sehr umsichtiger Gastgeber: er stellte alles zur Verfügung, was den Aufenthalt angenehm macht (Fön und sogar Morgenmäntel im Zimmer, eine Auswahl von Shampoos und Duschbädern, Leuchten für die komfortablen Fahrräder, die mit 6-Gangschaltung ausgestattet sind, Informationsmaterial mit Stadtplänen und Reiseführern und vieles mehr) und sorgte aufmerksam für das Frühstück. Er nahm sich immer Zeit für unsere Fragen und für anregende Gespräche. Wir kommen gerne wieder.
4296384;58440359;2016-01-02;52169707;Aurora;"- The room was perfect.
- The location was surprisingly convenient (1 minute to the metro, which takes you in 5 minutes to the very center).
- The apartment was super cute. Artistic, lots of character, while totally comfortable.
- Paul was simply the nicest guy ever, a calm, softspoken gentleman. An absolutely perfect mix of catering to my every need and leaving me totally independent."
4296384;62529234;2016-02-15;2074776;Margherita;"Paul has been as kind as helpfull as I read from all the other feedbacks in the website!
Really nice and warm staying!
The house was clean and functional, close to the metto station; add to this he let us use his bikes to have a real Amsterdam experience!
I would stay there again for sure!"
4296384;70565037;2016-04-18;7980879;Thomas;Paul was a very nice host. The room is nice and welcoming, it had everything you'd need on a vacation and the free museum card and included breakfast was very convenient. It's a 15-20 min walk from there to the centrum or just 3 stops with metro. I liked it and would recommend it!
4296384;86451600;2016-07-16;63950883;Antonio;Staying with Paul was really nice and comforting. We felt very at home at Paul's and his flat is artistic and cozy. We especially enjoyed the wonderful bikes to help us explore the city.
4296384;94400111;2016-08-15;67212667;Margaret;Paul had everything we needed--outlet converters, umbrellas, bikes, museumkarts, a shelf of books about Amsterdam. He was very friendly and offered to help where needed, but left us alone and wasn't hovering all the time.  The location was great--close to the metro. We really appreciated all he did for us while we were in Amsterdam. A very good experience.
4296384;99281694;2016-09-04;81985026;Priscilla;"Paul was very detailed and home was prepared impecable for my arrival.  He thought of everything to make my stay comfortable.  He shared museum pass and a bike to access the city.  Location is about 20 minutes by taxi from airport (metro nearby but I didn't use,) and very central to city square by bike, about 15 minutes.  You can walk everywhere.
Bed was confortable and he provided room essentials.
I had the luxury to spend my arrival night in his company and we cruised the Van Gough museum and city!
I highly recommend Paul's home, best host so far."
4296384;104620349;2016-09-27;34775281;Alessandra;we only stayed for one night, so there's no much to tell. Instructions were very easy and clear. The apartment is located on a very easy to acess area. Any metro takes you there, and only a few minutes from central station. It's a beautiful area. Our host left the apartment with all we could need (food and cleaning supplies).
4296384;106255671;2016-10-05;89712063;Wenjing;The flat is cozy, quite, clean and nearby metro. Bikes are provided. Breakfast is included. Check in check out time is flexible. We have nice stay in Paul's place.
4296384;114177232;2016-11-16;52345295;Jesus;"Everything was perfect. Paul look after every detail to make you feel you are at home. The location is great, quiet and 10 minutes far from centre by cycle. There isn't anything I could miss... 
I'll stay back in his house without thinking twice!"
4296384;120997502;2016-12-13;158149;Brad;We enjoyed our stay with Paul.  It's close enough to the centre that you don't have to take the metro - we didn't. Paul recommended areas to see that we enjoyed (Nieuwmarket) and others (Jordaan) we didn't get to (maybe because we walked!)  Very hospitable considerate and responsive.
4296384;131865965;2017-02-14;17919987;Aina;Paul is a fantastic host, great attention to detail in providing everything you might need as a guest in Amsterdam, from bikes to museum passes to guide books and information. The apartment is very cosy with a super comfortable bed, and 4 metro stations from Centraal station so access is easy (45min walk if you like walking!) Thanks Paul!
7767955;43172592;2015-08-17;5853045;Cheng Heng;I really enjoy my stay at this place,and I would definately recommend this place friends. Pretty big for a flat.

The apartment was as we wanted : clean, bright , well equipped and quiet .The location of the apartment was perfect.

C'était propre, les lits étaient très confortable, le patio était très mignon, j'ai pu boire le thé offert par Julie sur la petite table dehors j'ai été ravie. 

Merci beaucoup Julie pour cet hébergement."
4461610;71859756;2016-04-29;59940570;Charles;Julie was a wonderful host and her place was very cool to stay in. It was an outside attachment almost like our own place outside. She allowed us to use her bikes to get around and was very accommodating with anything we needed. Amsterdam was easy to maneuver and we came on kings day (by coincidence) which Julie was able to help us with since we were a bit overwhelmed. I would stay here again especially because of the beautiful view along the water!
4461610;76732113;2016-05-29;38749821;Jonas;"Julie welcomed us warmly and made us instantly feel at home!
She showed us everything and gave us advice where to buy groceries etc., she even had a selfmade book with lots of tourist information about Amsterdam in our room. The room itself and the bathroom was very clean, the beds were comfortable and she even changed our towels altough we only stayed for two nights! All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would come back anytime!"

985365;4167669;2013-04-15;5543393;Петр;"The nicest place. It is big enough, has two small bedrooms and big hall. Andrew told us everything about Amsterdam: where to go, where to eat, and etc. 

Water, electricity - everything worked perfectly. As an example: our friends lived in another places and had different problems, such as no warm water.

Apparatament has everything you may need, so don't worry about anything. 

We'd really loved this place, so, hope, you will too."
985365;11693229;2014-04-12;7469424;Bronwen;This was really the perfect apartment from which to explore Amsterdam.  Andrew welcomed us right away and gave us a great intro to the city.  The apartment was just perfect for our family of four, with a great master bedroom and a smaller bedroom for the kids.  The description on the site is 100% accurate, and the open kitchen/living room floor plan made the apartment very homy.  Everything is available for making breakfast in the morning as we did each day.  Description and instructions for getting to the apartment are accurate and his map is truly the best we could find!!  He also provided us with all the best hidden places of the neighborhood.  If you have a chance, don't miss Boom Chicago!  Truly a great stay.  Thanks!
985365;13323829;2014-05-25;15316235;Brett;Andrew's apartment was awesome-- we were able to fit 5 people comfortably. The location is very ideal, just a short walk to restaurants and a grocery. Andrew was a very accommodating host and had great recommendations. Also, I would definitely suggest going to his Boom Chicago comedy show-- one of our favorite parts of the trip!
985365;13954573;2014-06-09;13406840;Carlos;Very central, well situated to walk everywhere,pubs , restaurants and shopping nearby,minutes to the districts either walking or by tram.....Tourboats in the canals are five minutes away..well priced .

2037191;11966954;2014-04-20;11233055;Mahdi;The apartment was really clean, nice and comfortable. The location was calm and also very near to Lidl and some bread and food shops. I did not meet Radostin since he was busy but his sister whom I met was a very kind person. The apartment was just like the pictures with modern furniture. The apartment is in third floor without any elevator. However we did not have any problem with this. My family and I had an excellent accommodation there for 4 nights.
2037191;12664482;2014-05-07;9414391;Giovanni;Very nice apartment! I recommend this beautiful and cheep apartment in a quiet and green area but central and connected with the most important points of the city.

Nous avons été accueillis par Milena qui au préalable nous a proposé de venir nous chercher à l'arrêt de bus.
L'appartement est propre et spacieux pour 6 personnes, avec 3 chambres (dont une contient la salle de bain) et 3 lits.
Le quartier est calme, l'appartement est bien situé.
Tram et bus à moins de 10 minutes à pied puis le centre ville se situe à environ 20 minutes.
Le seul bémol : l'odeur de tabac froid couverte partiellement par des parfums de synthèse."

13839724;96259033;2016-08-22;16815732;Chayne;David and Jenna  were great hosts! Their apartment is close to quite a few main attractions that can be easily walked to. Their apartment is clean and as advertised. Overall it was a great experience!
13839724;100630718;2016-09-10;22199730;Ismênia;Ótima localização! Pudemos com muita facilidade visitar muito pontos turísticos, visitar museus e outros lugares através de transporte público e inclusive a pé. O David foi muito gentil e atencioso para nos dar orientações necessárias e nos deixou bem a vontade. Foi ótimo! Recomendo.

14044202;103261327;2016-09-21;3525825;Ivy;Nice apartment for couple, it's new and it provide all you needed! The decoration is very nice and it's very clean ! It's not far from Ams central station, it takes around 15 mins by train!  Lora lets us know how to get to the apartment and the nearest tourists place ! Overall, a very nice stay! Thank you!
14044202;104558345;2016-09-27;89338985;Victoria;The location was great, close to trams and places to eat. Apartment was clean and welcoming. Great view of the canal! We had a short but pleasant stay.
14044202;126930581;2017-01-15;30708816;Sharon;This apartment is great. The stairs are very steep and narrow but other than that I cannot recommend it enough. It is modern but homely, easy to find and to get to places from. My husband and I stayed with our teenage daughter and were all very impressed with the apartment, facilities and agreed that we could have stayed for a couple of weeks and still been comfortable. Great communication from the host.
14044202;131027202;2017-02-10;3025439;Nicholas;"Great location, easy to walk to lots of great restaurants, bars, coffee shops and sites.
We loved our stay here and would definitely stay again"
14744853;115638983;2016-11-26;1200169;John;It was easy to make a reservation and heard from Paula within an hour of having made it. No problems at all coordinating our early arrival (we were on a flight that landed at 6:55 a.m.) We weren't able to get into the apt that early in the morning, but Paula let us leave our bags and we returned later in the day when she gave us a quick tour of the apt, complete with a small bag of stroopwaffels as a welcome. The apt is lovely with a clean, contemporary interiors and furnishings, a view of the canal and a terrace (which we didn't use as visiting in the winter). There is a full kitchen, though we used it only to make coffee. The apt is on the top floor of a row house, so some steep flights of steps to climb. It's also located to the west of the heart of the historic district and tourist sites. It's only about a ten-minute tram ride plus a few minutes walking and a nice, quiet neighborhood.
14744853;121224719;2016-12-15;55243622;Dana;Our stay at Paula's was just one day on our return home. Paula accommodated an early checkin for us and was wonderful to communicate with. The apartment is absolutely wonderful- unique, open, sunny and just perfect.  Paula also put up a little Christmas tree for us too! The kitchen is also well equipped for cooking along with some of Paula's favorite cookbooks. Great neighborhood for walking with a few cute restaurants nearby. Thank you again for a great stay!
14744853;123451251;2016-12-29;105719478;Flavia;The apartment was perfect. Great location, and Paula is super nice! Would definitely book again.
14744853;128369779;2017-01-24;108342099;Emily;Lovely apartment, nice layout, warm and both Paula and her husband were helpful and friendly.
14744853;132797403;2017-02-19;67501969;Sarah;"Logement bien situé près du centre. Accueil très bien. 
Paula très sympa. 
Logement agréable et lumineux.
Seul bémol, on a peur de faire du bruit car nous sommes situés dans le logement du propriétaire.
Merci Paula nous avons passé un très bon séjour.
Très très bon lit !!"
606871;4622089;2013-05-16;3116162;Fernando;"The place was clean, with a very good bed and excellent shower. The gentle rocking of the house and the birds by the water complimented the floating house experience, heating and Air condition working perfectly. Location was good in a quiet neighborhood with lots of transportation options to the major parts of the city. 

But the best was Diewert. On our second day my wife suffered an accident and broke her ankle. This completly destroyed our holidays. However Diewert was very helpful and accomodating: told me where to find open drugstores, got some extra info from the hospital that I needed for my insurance, helped us order some food since my wife couldn't walk around, lent me his bike so I could run some errands, booked our taxi when I found a flight back home, among many other smal things. This attitude helped smooth the situation we found ourselves in.

We hope to go back to Amsterdam and experience the city properly with no accidents. Hopefully Diewert will be a part of that experience once again."
606871;19730198;2014-09-17;18965606;Seungyeon;"Stayed at Diewert's place for 2 nights. 
Diewert and his wife are very friendly. 
House boat location was perpect. The neighborhood is quite and very close to tram and bus. 
It's in a very quiet and safe area. 
We really enjoyed on houseboat."
606871;20243436;2014-09-26;16892218;Emma;La maison Houseboat de Diewert est située dans un endroit très calme et proche du centre ville. Accueil très sympathique, chambre très bien aménagée avec une jolie salle d'eau. On y dort très bien. A recommander.
606871;21513045;2014-10-19;8536440;Maria;"It's a cute houseboat in a quite but central location. Our room was nice and clean. Diewert was very friendly and helpful. He made our stay as uncomplicated ad possible although we did not meet in person by very informative emails and sending a friend who welcomed us.
Thanks a lot - I hope to stay again at your swimming mini hotel soon!"

606871;23750032;2014-12-09;309332;Su Yi;We had a really great experience at Diewert's houseboat in Amsterdam. The location was great, can easily walk to everywhere in the city. The place itself was nice, clean and had everything you need for a comfortable stay. Diewert himself is really friendly and made us feel very welcome - you'll have maps to the city and he gave us great suggestions on places to eat around the area. All in all an amazing stay and hope to be back again!
606871;28783712;2015-03-30;26430157;Robert;"The houseboat is very clean and the bed extremely comfortable
We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam even though the weather was very bad
We would consider going again in summertime"
606871;46482468;2015-09-11;37999284;Jmarie;We we welcomed by Diewert's lovely wife and children.  The houseboat was exactly as described . We really like the neighborhood.  It was quiet and had lots of trees.   Diewert had bikes that we could rent for a small fee which was very helpful!
606871;66155320;2016-03-20;53551310;Wim;Rustig gelegen, goed verzorgde kamer. Mooie badkamer en erg vriendelijke en behulpzame verhuurders. Dichtbij openbaar vervoer, supermarkt, restaurant en barretjes.
15066052;107350976;2016-10-10;71922159;Jess;"Our stay in Amsterdam was amazing! Minda was a great host and we felt extremely welcomed!! 
The place was immaculate, the bed was extremely comfortable, and Minda had added lovely touches like a packet of traditional dutch stoopwaffels for us to try. The description of the place was accurate and Minda was very helpful in explaining public transport options and directions around the town.
Unfortunately we didn't have long in Amsterdam so had limited time talking and getting to know Minda but when we did he was friendly and easy going, with great recommendations about what to do and where to eat. It was our first experience using an Air BnB and feel that Minda has set a high stabdard!!! I would highly recommend staying here and would love to come back and stay again!"
15066052;126896516;2017-01-15;95452139;Feargal;Really enjoyed our stay in the apartment. Mindaugas was a friendly and respectable host. Helps out with information regarding the city.
12771038;87135926;2016-07-18;12671015;Pedro;The room is wonderful, Jacob and his wife were very kind and polite with us, they made our journey more comfortable, we wish to come back to Jacob's apartment soon. Thanks for everything Jacob and Grace.
12771038;91195928;2016-08-04;64102335;Laurie;This was our first experience with Airbnb and we are so glad we chose to stay at Jacob and Inge's home. The location was just what we were looking for, quiet and convenient to travel to all areas of the city. The rental space was excellent, just like the pictures portray. There is ample space and privacy. Jacob and Inge communicated very well. All the way up to our arrival they were available to answer any questions we had concerning transportation and directions to thier home which is about a ten minute walk from the train station. The tram/bus station is just around the corner from the home about three minutes away. We really enjoyed meeting and talking with Jacob and Inge, they are very hospitable and knowledgeable about the city. We appreciate all of their kindness very much and would stay with them again if we ever find ourselves in Amsterdam.
12771038;102456880;2016-09-18;5794391;Real;Had a wonderful time with two of my favourite new people. I could not have been cared for better .. such a fun, worldly, charismatic and nurturing couple, felt blessed.  I had a beautiful stay in a lovely room, in the most well placed apartment for Amsterdam sightseeing. Just sorry I didn't have more time there. Many thanks and promise I will be back! Penny will miss me!!! x

12771038;138881774;2017-03-22;70705498;Nelda;"Inge and Jacob were the best hosts I could have hoped for, so very kind and helpful.  The spacious bedroom and private bathroom were immaculately kept, and exactly as pictured and described.  The location is very convenient- only a 5-minute walk to the tram (#2) stop.  The tram takes you to all the major attractions (Van Gogh museum, Rijksmuseum, flower market, Dam Square, central railway station, etc.). 

I highly recommend staying at this apartment during your visit to Amsterdam."

She has taken great care to help her visitors feel at home including leaving manuals for her appliances and suggestions for both practical and fun outings in and around Amsterdam.

2059066;11398999;2014-04-01;8024710;Severin;"We had a nice stay in Max's and his friends house. He and his friends were very  nice and helpful. The house is very central to the red light district. They have a nice garden and if you have the right room, you can enjoy the view over the canal with all the peoples who walks there all the day. 
Highly recommend Max's house, we will come back when we travel again to Amsterdam."
2059066;16178093;2014-07-22;6920842;Anna;The house was very nice and very central. Not so easy to find because there is no house number outside. So the location is really perfect if you stay in Amsterdam. Also Ivo and Rens, the roommates from Max were helpful and nice to us. We were also invited to go with them to a personal boat trip on a really big and comfortable boat. It was amazing. The rooms were big enough for two people and the bath we also had for us alone. The only thing was the cleanness could be a little bit better. But in all we enjoyed it very much.
12540879;112101226;2016-11-04;8622046;Marit;"I had an amazing stay in Marions' place. It's a warm, cosy and comfortable apartment, with everything you need.  It's very centrally located and easy accessible with public transport. The neigbourhood offers many nice shops, restaurants and cafes. Or you can walk to the city center or take a stroll in Westerpark. 

Marion is a great host! She responded very quickly on messages and upon arrival she offered to help arranging bikes and gave us some nice tips about the area where to go. Also storing the luggage a few hours more was not a problem.  
I had an awesome time in Amsterdam and I would definitely come back."
14508024;97380209;2016-08-27;54021628;Li Ting;The apartment is very new one, clean  bedroom and living room, especially the balcony is very great and nice  and host will help us pick up luggage to 1F. and we found blend didn't work,  Ivan and Marcel very patient to help us to fix and change new one for us. so nice. It just walk 3 mins to tram 17 station and supermarket. It good  experience to stay the apartment.
14508024;109042397;2016-10-18;11448695;Shona;We had a perfect stay in Ivan's flat! Marcel took us to and from the airport, and was a very friendly welcome to the city and flat! We enjoyed exploring Amsterdam and the flat was the ideal base - we walked everywhere and found lots of nice cafes and shops in the neighbourhood. The cosy flat was well equipped, including very comfy beds, umbrellas just in case, guide books, maps and travel cards, a coffee machine and everything we needed in the kitchen. The balcony is under cover with nice chairs, making it a great extra space to relax. We saw lots of the city during our 3 night stay but also spent lots of time feeling very at home in this place - very highly recommended!

11247862;125111964;2017-01-03;62860557;Peter;Perfect place to stay for a group or family wanting to explore the city. Walking distance from all major attractions. Great facilities throughout the house, with a cosy open fire for use. Good communication with lodewijk and easy check in. Would recommend highly.
2779916;26611749;2015-02-16;26264844;Felicity;Patrick was waiting for us when we arrived and showed us everything we needed to know about the apartment, including a very welcome stash of beers he'd left for us in the fridge! The apartment is lovely, exactly as in the photographs with lots of space, incredibly comfortable, warm and the ideal location for exploring the city. Everything is within pretty easy walking distance but the apartment is also very near the brilliant tram network. The apartment was spotlessly clean with all of the amenities you could want, Patrick was a warm and welcoming host and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this as a wonderful place to stay in this most delightful city. Thank you Patrick!
2779916;27211215;2015-02-28;11411321;Khairi;Patrick greeted us upon our arrival and was extremely friendly and helpful. He had 2 cold beers in the fridge and a red bottle of wine waiting for us :) The location of the apartment was great and the actual apartment was very spacious and comfortable.

I completely would recommend his apartment to my friends"
2779916;92745304;2016-08-09;23649911;Stephen;We had a great time staying in Patrick's place in Amsterdam. It's bright, spacious and clean. The location is perfect. Right close to leidseplein, our favorite part of the city . The bus from the airport brings you straight out for 5 Euro. Patrick was a pleasure to deal with. Well be back.
11559829;72122578;2016-05-01;65017911;Alex;Appartement très bien situé pour se déplacer à pied, près du centre ville et des musées dans une ruelle calme. Malheureusement la propreté laisse à désirer (sanitaires non nettoyés, poubelles et torchons sales), évier de la cuisine bouché. Il n'y a donc pas de rapport entre le prix de la nuitée (250 € pour 3 personnes) et la qualité de l'hébergement proposé.
11559829;139605747;2017-03-26;55546162;Daniel;Apartment is a great location. Not too close to the wild nightlife but every place is walkable. A 5min walk from the museum quarter.
10509643;65355191;2016-03-13;57985063;Hamid;The appartement looks exactly like the pictures. It is decorated with taste and the white walls and the furniture are very soothing. We were 30 minutes late but the host was there waiting for us with a big smile on his face when he opened the door. The neighbourhood is very pleasant and quiet. Lots of restaurants, shops... at walking distance. The tram station is very close to the appartement (line 13 going straight to Central station and 14 going to Amsterdam city center). We couldn't have imagined a better place to stay for this 3 days week-end visiting Amsterdam.
10509643;75674601;2016-05-22;41520102;Ionut;Great apartment quiet and good situated.
10509643;87058165;2016-07-18;19944265;Sandra;Great, cosy and confortable appartment where you can find all you need. Really like the garden. 2 big tables outside and inside. There was a little sanitary problems with the shower who is puggled. Instead of that my week end was perfect. Thank you Susan!
10509643;124612916;2017-01-02;76203541;Elliot;Apartment and host were fantastic, arrival was smooth and any issues we had were dealt with quickly. Thanks for a great stay!

Easy commute on tram 13 to centre of city!"
9741478;125136741;2017-01-04;10494823;John;"This flat is fantastic.  It is clean, roomy for 2 couples and extremely comfortable with a great layout and great amenities.  The location is spectacular on the edge of the Jordan district so there's easy walking access to restaurants and bars ranging from simple neighborhood types, to ethnic to high end modern cuisine.  Pesca, a fantastic seafood restaurant with a modern concept, is reasonably priced and 2 blocks away.  It is not to be missed.  The Ann Frank museum is 2 blocks away as is the ""9's"" shopping district.  We actually walked from the train station, pulling our luggage, in 20 minutes.  Bicycles are everywhere, easy to rent and a great way to cruise around town.  Amsterdam is flat.  The host is extremely personable, very helpful and thorough.  He communicated with me regularly before we arrived and was waiting at the flat at 8 am so we could settle in after our overnight flat.  Very accommodating.  He also offered to arrange transportation to the airport when we departed.  Thanks!!  I know I should come up with something negative so this review seems balanced, but it's honestly hard to think of how this place could be noticeably improved short of being 3 times as large, have an elevator and come with a maid, a cook, and a butler.  I guess I could say the pillows on the beds could be better.  They're kind of flat and firm.  But I'm searching here for something to complain about and that's pretty much all I can come up with.  This is a fabulous place to stay in Amsterdam."
9181640;68360697;2016-04-04;15089738;Benjamin;Accueil sympathique et très arrangeant. Idéalement situé en bord de canal, proche centre à pied mais au calme.
9181640;74919281;2016-05-17;38801174;Jennifer;The apartment was exactly as described and in the pictures. My husband and I prefer more authentic traveling and places to stay, and this was exactly it. Close to everything and an easy walk to just about anywhere. Jesse was a great communicator and so flexible with our arrival time. He made sure to greet us and show us around the home. If arriving by car, park at the Parking Centrum Oosterdok, Oosterdoksstraat (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) DK Amsterdam, Netherlands. 10Euro for 24hrs, right in the center and about a 40 minute easy and beautiful walk back to this place. Thank you for a great stay, Jesse!
9181640;80056073;2016-06-15;49334915;Lauren;Jesse was very responsive, attentive, and helpful. He always responded within a few hours (even with a 6 hour time difference) and made sure I felt comfortable and all my questions were answered. When I arrived he was even friendlier in person! The apartment was sooooo cute haha. And the view is great, it was also a lot bigger than I was expecting. The area is perfect and you can easily catch the tram/bus/ or walk to central areas. I would definitely recommend this place and stay here again. Thanks Jesse!
9181640;102736339;2016-09-19;75632755;William;Great location, close to restaurants, cafes, and transit. Spacious room with everything you need for a comfortable stay in Amsterdam!
9181640;117193973;2016-12-05;49741186;Oscar José;The room was really nice. It is a big room in the center of Amsterdam, with a balcon with view to a canal. There is a little kitchen and a bathroom. It was exactly like the photos. There were facilities near the apartment, like markets, transport and restaurants. They did not received us but the comunication was clear and easy. I had some difficulties with the heaters, but later I think I found its way. Thanks for the opportunity and highly recomend this place.

10800886;67594876;2016-03-30;11448214;Simon;"This was a great apartment and great location for a weekend of exploring. The hosts Anna and Diederik were fantastic. Prior to arriving the contact and exchange of information was easy, smooth and fast. Anna gave very detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment. It turned out we would not need these as Anna kindly offered to meet us at the airport as she was already going to be there. This was great as it meant we could get lots of advice in where to go and what to do on our short trip. 

The Apartment is beautifully presented, clean and has everything you could need. The location is great and just outside the busy central canal ways. The tram stop is 90m outside the front door and takes 5/10mins to get into the centre. However you don't need the tram as it is a beautiful walk in towards the centre. 

I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone and we had a great 3 days exploring Amsterdam and I must thank Anna and Diederik for all the great suggestions on what to do in a short period of time. 

The big bonus for me was that directly opposite the apartment is a great bar with local craft beers from all around and plus great food. 

A big thank you to Anna and Diederik for making our weekend away so easy and letting us stay in their beautiful apartment.

We were 6 adults and it was comfortable in overall. The kitchen is well 
equipped. We arrived very late and it was ok with Seb, we met Yalcin at the apartment and he was very nice.
Location was worth it all, close to everything!
Would come back to stay there."
6620804;51547348;2015-10-21;44187712;Sandra;"Nuestra estancia en casa de Dick y su familia ha sido muy agradable. La casa es muy bonita y al ser su vivienda habitual dispone de todas las facilidades al alcance de la mano. Una pena que el tiempo no acompañase para disfrutar del jardín. 
La única pega es la ubicación, ya que queda un poquito retirada del centro.
En cuanto a Dick, todo ha sido muy sencillo. Ha respondido a cada mensaje en poco tiempo y ha estado a nuestra disposición durante nuestra estancia por si surgía algún problema.
Muy recomendable."

He kindly answers your questions and it doesn't take long for a response. The feedback of other people was accurate and they were all right about Robert; he is very nice and really a person to talk to about everything. We talked about science, Europe and lifestyle. It was a pleasant stay near a great park and in a very central, lively neighborhood."
3278963;32290330;2015-05-16;32975464;Martina;The best place ever! Robert is an amazing host, the apartment is very clean, and the location is perfect. I really enjoyed staying there during my solo trip to Amsterdam.
3278963;34364806;2015-06-07;32741813;Irina;"Robert, many thanks for your warm host!! 
The location is very good, very close to the city center on a quiet street. On the first floor there is a supermarket that is very convenient to buy some snacks on your way. It was easy to find it, even for me)))"
3278963;35265591;2015-06-16;13052899;Robert;Robert was a very easy going guy and great to stay with. His place is in a great location and I enjoyed my stay very much. Thanks Robert!
3278963;96293115;2016-08-22;35995186;Marco;"Robert ha atteso per il mio arrivo fino alle 22.30 ed è sempre stato gentile e disponibile per tutta la durata del soggiorno. La descrizione dell'appartamento è precisa. Il quartiere carino e relativamente vicino al centro, si può fare una bella passeggiata di 25 minuti per arrivarci, altrimenti si può prendere il tram.

Robert has waited for my check-in till 22.30 and has been very kind and helpful with me. The description is accurate, the location is quite close to the citycenter and it's nice to have a walk to reach it. Otherwise there is public transport."

8100829;52357442;2015-10-28;6490918;Lee;Amazing little boat, in a nice little location about 10 mins from the centre if that! Anneke is a great host and everything is perfect for a nice little romantic stay! Thanks Anneke! Just needs a hairdryer, however she did lend us hers!
4177102;20867807;2014-10-06;21610638;Juliane;To stay at Annabelle´s house was a very nice, quiet and relaxed experience. She was very kind, helpful and always open for a little chat. The room is comfortable, bright, clean and you will even find a little terrace in the backyard. And even a cookie jar on the shelf is a nice thing after a long flight :) There is a private bathroom for the guests. The house was not located in the very city centre, which is not too bad as you can rent bikes and you will be there in 10-15 minutes. Thank you for the stay. Jule
4177102;22951597;2014-11-18;22323389;Vladimir;"The room is just as it is desctibed: small, but very neat, clean and comfortable with a terrace and a separate bathroom for the guests. There's a electric teapot and and it is possible to use the fridge in the storage room. The groceries can be bought in one of the supermarkets in the area. Annabelle also kindly provides teabags, instant coffee and сream, tasty cookies and Dutch sweets. There're also cups, plates and cutlery in the room, so although breakfast is not included the guests can easily have it on their own.

The neighborhood is very nice, calm and authentic. It may appear isolated from the center, but transportwise it is actually quite good. It only takes 15 minutes too get to the central station by bike and 20 minutes to the center itself. If you're not into biking, then tram #26 will take you to the station in 14 minutes and #10 - to the museum district in about 18 minutes.

Annabelle is discreet and helpful. And her pets are just adorable :)"
4177102;30388261;2015-04-21;18100075;Lorène;Superbe voyage à Amsterdam. La chambre et la terrasse sont comme sur la photo propre et accueillant. Annabelle est une super hôte. Merci beaucoup ! Et à bientôt
4177102;33419034;2015-05-27;28029575;Zachary;Nice room,  great location.  Loved the private balcony.
4177102;40292648;2015-07-29;24023314;Robert;"Annabelle is a delightful and accomodating host who makes you feel very welcome.
The space is small but very comfortable.
If catching the tram from central look for the ""A"" sign where you find the No. 26 tram. 
If it is raining I would suggest a taxi from Central as it is a 20min walk and a bit difficult to find once you get off the tram.
Once there you can hire a bike from Annabelle and the rest is easy.
I recommend to light travellers, good for singles and maybe young couples. Will be difficult for elderly couples. My opinion only.
All in all good value"
4177102;65378816;2016-03-13;57634095;Michelle;The House is directly by the water. We werde very impressed. The whole district is quite nicely . The room and the bathroom are very beautiful and clean. We had our own balcony with beautiful furniture. It gelt like home. Annabelle is a really kind Host. She answered all our questions and made us a lovely home!
4177102;66103365;2016-03-19;37452573;Greta;Nice stay in Annabelle's lovely house. We also have a good time riding in the city on her two bikes. Everything is perfect :-)

It was exactly as described and the patio is a great plus. She was very helpful on indicating us a few unmissable spots and a very pleasant person as well. Would recommend.
4177102;80564981;2016-06-18;30959341;Narelle;Thanks Annabelle for a lovely stay at your house, the room was as described, very clean, enough room and the sofa bed was very comfortable. We appreciated Annabelle giving us lots of local knowledge when we arrived. It was also very useful having access to the microwave to prepare simple foods .
4177102;93012245;2016-08-11;19503205;Cynthia;Very thoughtful host. A lot of privacy. Ur own bathroom n small make shift kitchen with coffee tea fridge microwave. Also very nice to provide biscuits, soup, fruits, utensils and even salt! Like what the rest have said the fold out couch is comfy but the walk in is a bit long -apprx 1km but there's minimal traffic. Can beat pulling ur luggage thru crowded Amsterdam central!
4177102;98292133;2016-08-30;14604473;Julian;Very nice place and a very friendly host
4177102;107758186;2016-10-12;3134178;Ian;Annabelle's patio room is a very comfortable and convenient place to stay. Annabelle is very helpful and provides all necessary information about the area. The location is great, near the water but close to central Amsterdam. It's very nice having the patio next to the room.
14070319;99269726;2016-09-04;19737210;Julia;Anne was a wonderfull host. She was very arranging for our time of arrival and departure. Her flat is lovely, big, with a lot of light (1 balcony) and very cosy. The location is perfect, in a nice area no too tourisy. I highly recommend Anne's flat for a weekend in Amsterdam!
13179198;97922294;2016-08-29;58905532;Catherine;Saskia's Property is absolutely fab.  Exactly what it says in the description, in a funky, quirky part of the city.  Really easy to access by tram or bike and Saskia was incredibly helpful before and during the visit.  Highly recommended.

The apartement and the neigbourhood were very nice."
4493007;52762330;2015-11-01;6493050;Samantha;Our stay at Alexander's place was great - perfect location and very nice place, good size for a studio. He was super nice and helpful.

His flat was what we expected"
4493007;66821916;2016-03-25;30925733;Dorothe;Alex was not in town but we had a great welcome by one of his (patient) friends! The appartment is small but extremely clean and  functional. The area is residential and lovely. Loads of cozy  bars, restaurants & shops in the neighbourhood. Tram and busstop to the city centre right by!
4493007;72158357;2016-05-01;50180386;Giulia;"Il miglior quartiere della città dove poter fare vere esperienze nei BruinCafè di altri tempi. 
Alexander è molto gentile e disponibile, check in anche a mezzanotte; casa pulita e con ogni comfort.
Unico particolare: i vicini. Bisogna camminare in punta di piedi altrimenti iniziano a picchiare sul soffitto.
Oltre a questo, direi tutto OTTIMO!"
4493007;82121322;2016-06-26;57426937;Summer;Our host was amazing! Alexander greeted us and helped us with bringing our luggage to the room. He also messaged me during our stay to make sure everything was going well! The apartment was just like the pictures and the neighborhood was better than expected! I didn't know it was right on a canal! Loved it so much!
4493007;93853561;2016-08-14;20052444;Paul;Great stay, loved how quiet and quaint the area was. Very close to great cafes and 5 mins away from the nearest Ahold Heijn for amenities.
4493007;95867484;2016-08-21;18857967;Laëtitia;The place is very nice, located in a lovely neighboroud, and Alexander is very welcoming. We recommend it!
953041;4554378;2013-05-12;6015995;Isabelle;"Dear Joyce,

Thank you very much for your welcoming. We spend four perfect days in Amsterdam. Your houseboat is very original, beautiful and clean ! It was a pleasure to spend time on it. The situation is just perfect (qualitative area, shopping, restaurants …).  I truly recommend this place for a couple who wants to spend romantic few days in the city ! A first successful experience on airbnb :-) 

Isabelle & Jean"
953041;5195682;2013-06-17;1388268;Reiko;"Amazing location, a great experience to stay in Amsterdam on a boat. Joyce is a helpful and gracious host. 

Having such a deep bath was a treat. The canal is lively during the day and night. light sleepers may have trouble but it didn't bother us."
953041;6239006;2013-08-05;4082342;Andy;"Great location for Gay pride. Nice location for Amsterdam, and generally a good setting. Joyce met us at checkin and offered advise on local ammenties.

Great bath! nice and deep plenty of hot water. Wifi works well, and great flooring. Bed comfortable.

The boat is well lived in, and is not a 4 star hotel, and this adds to the charme of visit. The only negative I would have is that its looking a little run down, and unfinished in places. Amazing wooden floor."
953041;7104776;2013-09-06;2741042;Michael;Joyce's place is not only a great dutch experience but a very clean and comfortable place. She is an excellent host. Even though I didn't get to meet her in person because of my tight schedule, she made sure I had everything and even traveled to the city to leave an iron I needed. From the moment I opened the door and found a welcome bottle of wine to the chance of having a drink on the boat terrace, everything was fantastic. Would definitely stay again and have recommended the place to some friends.
953041;14419606;2014-06-18;8161859;Priscila;"We had a wonderful time at Joyce's boat, which was promptly prepared for us in the same day we submitted our reservation (same evening, in fact!). 
The place looks just as great in reality as it does in the pictures, it's a perfect accommodation for romantic couples in need of some quality time. The neighbourhood is also very pretty, with plenty of options nearby, and we really enjoyed watching the other boats passing by in the evening from the big windows - but don't worry, it's a lot quieter overnight. Our sleep was very pleasant and the bath a bit of a challenge, but an excellent experience overall. 
I'm definitely recommending this place to all my friends!"
953041;15702501;2014-07-14;867637;Greg;We had the pleasure of staying at Joyce's wonderful boat house home. She was a gracious host, extremely helpful and a pleasure to deal with! We stayed for 3 nights and absolutely loved it. The location is perfect - seconds away from Ann Frank house, 10 min ride to the central station and close to a ton of great restaurants and bars. The Jordan district is the best place to stay in Amsterdam and we were so glad that Joyce opened up her home for us. Could not recommend her enough!
953041;20049214;2014-09-22;3250785;Nicholas;"Joy's houseboat is the perfect place for a visiting couple who appreciate the romanticism of adventure and trying new things. The location was top notch and the boat had every amenity for a perfect weekend, despite its size. In classic Dutch fashion, life on the boat was carefree and we had no qualms about taking Joy up on her recommendation of leaving the canal doors open all day and night long. Sleeping, bathing, and relaxing on the couch were particularly accentuated by the presence of the canal at your doorstep. Joy, herself, was welcoming, communicative, and a wonderful hostess. A note to curious travelers: the is zero sensation of ""seasickness"" on the houseboat if that is something you're worried about. While the houseboat does rock very slightly when the canal is particularly busy, we found the whole experience to be mostly soothing."
953041;22587351;2014-11-10;13788530;Dane;Can not provide better feedback on this amazing find. Joyce was was nothing but helpful, friendly and went the extra mile to make our stay as enjoyable as it was. The accommodation is every bit as beautiful as it looks in the photos, and I'm sure would be great in summer, but having gone in winter it was super cozy, with a beautiful fireplace and view of the canal. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a getaway in Amsterdam. Thanks Joyce, will be back soon hopefully!
953041;38705043;2015-07-18;30902895;Florence;"Notre hote nous attendait comme convenu sur son bateau, avec son sourire, une bouteille de vin petillant et nous avons bien échangé.
Le bateau fait partie du plaisir d'être a Amsterdam ! Il est toutefois un peu penché (donc nous aussi...)  car plus enfoncé d'un coté que de l'autre, un peu en désordre aussi, et avec un lave-vaisselle et un four inutilisables.  Les grandes baies vitrées sont très agréables même si l'absence d'une petite terrasse en bois (qui a du exister, d'après la photo...) le long du bateau oblige a s'asseoir a terre et a l'intérieur.
Situation géographique au top, on peut tout faire a pied. Rue agréable aussi, avec un spécialiste de pancakes et petits déjeuners a 50 mètres..."
953041;86146258;2016-07-15;70327380;Sharon;In één woord een perfect! Ik heb de boot voor een langere tijd gehuurd vanwege een grote filmproductie in Amsterdam en Joyce heeft me perfect geholpen. Ik mocht voor ik geboekt heb eerst komen kijken of dit was wat ik zocht, ze was erg flexibel tijdens de periode met tussentijdse schoonmaak en wat ook belangrijk is is dat het precies zo is zoals ze het beschrijft. Het is een perfecte locatie voor vakantiegangers, maar ook zeker voor een werkbezoek zoals bij mij. Een heerlijke plek om je even terug te trekken na een drukke dag.
5613210;46730237;2015-09-13;16528627;Liran;"David has been a great host.
The apartment is located in the best area of Amsterdam, super nice, and clean.
My girlfriend and I came over for a wedding and I need to iron some clothes after the travel, I asked David and he instantly responded saying they don't have one but he will go and buy one, when I came back from lunch it was already in the apartment. 
Thanks a lot David!"
5613210;51134947;2015-10-18;42387417;Nicola;This is a beautiful, quirky space just minutes walk from the trendy 9 streets area. It is very cool to stay in a gallery in such an arty city, and the space really works. It is tastefully decorated and on a lovely quiet street so we had a great night's sleep! David was friendly, responsive, accommodating and easy going. Overall, a great stay and we would stay again! Thanks David and Phoebe

She was so sweet to bring me over delicious dutch desserts as a goodbye. I would definitely recommend it and I would love to visit her again.
1232131;35026932;2015-06-14;35123696;Ben;"Omyra was a fantastic host. Her directions to the room were accurate and easily understood. She was very kind and the room was very pleasant. 

The actual room is certainly on the outskirts of Amsterdam, but that's okay because it was very close to excellent public transportation. The 1 tram line had a stop right outside the apartment and an airport bus was available every half hour. 

At the end of my stay Omyra gifted me a box of local food stuffs, a treat I thought was very thoughtful. I very much enjoy the cultural exchange and I am looking forward to trying them. 

I highly recommend this room and his."

We wish we had a longer stay there to enjoy the apartment, the wonderful balcony off of the bedroom, and the surrounding neighborhood. There is no lack of cafes, restaurants, and bars nearby. Communication with Kirsten was prompt. Despite an honest misunderstanding between us regarding check-in, Kirsten was quick to come up with a solution and make sure that everything was taken care of, which we appreciated. She even helped us arrange for a taxi to the airport the following morning. I would definitely stay here again!

8904072;53545655;2015-11-09;47770192;Kitty;"Fran's place was absolutely perfect for our weekend in Berlin! The flat is really cosy and the decorations that Fran's collected from her travels are really interesting and unique. The flat is in Wedding and is just a two minute walk from an underground station, making it really easy to get into the centre of Berlin. We didn't spend much time in Wedding itself but it seems like a nice area and the people we interacted with were all really friendly.

Although Fran wasn't there to greet us because she was away in Greece, she made the whole experience really easy and was excellent at keeping in touch and answering any questions we had. She came back home just before we left for the airport on our last day so we had a few minutes to meet and discuss our travels. She was more than helpful and offered us tea and also helped us find the quickest route to the airport.

We couldn't have asked for a better stay, the apartment was lovely and Fran was incredibly helpful and welcoming. We 100% recommend staying here!"

The flat itself is fantastic, it's in a great location - close to a couple of bars, restaurants and a metro stop allowing you to get anywhere in the city. The apartment looks rustic from the outside but inside it is really, modern, well-kept and spacious - it slept 9 of us comfortably.

Chris est un hôte très courtois, sérieux et toujours disponible pour répondre aux question à la fois pour nous remettre les clés, pour nous donner les informations dont nous avions besoin sur la ville, les transports, les restaurants, etc. Chris nous a aussi proposé des draps de bain et des boissons chaudes. L'immeuble dans lequel vit Chris est bien isolé, bien chauffé, spacieux et éclairé. Je recommanderais vivement cet appartement à toute personne qui va à Berlin.
677598;3849799;2013-03-20;5415184;Eva;I think everything is already said here. Chris and Su are great hosts and we felt very much at home in their flat. And also the surroundings of their place are great! Too late we started to experience all the nice restaurants and cafes around. We highly recommend them!
677598;5750926;2013-07-15;6138180;Kathryn;Staying with Chris and Su was a great decision. They were warm and accommodating and the location of their apartment is excellent. I felt I could come and go as I pleased and the room is super spacious and comfortable. There are many great cafes and restaurants in the area, and the s-bahn and u-bahn plus the trams are at their doorstep. I found it was still an easy walk to Alexanderplatz anyway, and the flea market at Mauerpark is a short walk from the apartment and worth a visit! As a lone traveller my stay with Chris and Su was great.
677598;14023507;2014-06-10;14197947;Andy;My girlfriend and I immensely enjoyed our stay at Chris and Su's place in Berlin. It's a great and safe location, right by the Schoenhauser Allee train stop, and near a bunch of great food and bar options. The room looks just like the pictures, and their flat comes with everything you would need. Furthermore, Chris and Su are incredibly kind hosts and very welcoming people. Highly recommended for a stay in Berlin!
677598;28232478;2015-03-20;28047995;Tong;地理位置非常好,在AB区交界的地方旁边有一个商场,地铁站和轻轨站,公寓周边晚上也很安静。房子里很干净,这点我很喜欢。住着一对非常友好的情侣,男的是英国人,女的是土耳其人,但都在德国带了好几年了。他们考虑很周全,很为客人着想,还很会开玩笑。最后一天还一起吃了晚餐,很不错。都是好话,没有什么负面评价。
677598;76079122;2016-05-24;65883250;Cassidy;Chris and Su were wonderful hosts and the apartment was lovely. Very easy to get to on transit, which was especially convenient coming from Schönefeld airport. It's situated in a cute part of the city with lots of cafés, market stalls and supermarkets. Thanks for a great stay!
677598;77391044;2016-05-31;60824661;Paula;Chris y su fueron muy buenos anfitriones, muy amables y nos hicieron sentir realmente muy bien. Conversábamos largo y tendido de diversos temas, muy amigables. También nos dieron información de que visitar y hay mapas en el departamento para usar en la estadía. La habitación y el departamento en general estaban impecables, todo muy limpio. La única critica es el futon que no es muy cómodo y la privacidad del nuestro dormitorio que estaba dividido por una puerta con su dormitorio y tratábamos de no hacer mucho ruido para no molestarlos. Fuera de eso todo es maravilloso. Volveríamos a hospedarnos con chris y su. Muy recomendable!!
677598;110134504;2016-10-24;72437166;Sophie;"We first got to the house with a quick walk from the station around 5 mins! And we're met by Chris who was working from home, he was so polite and helpful and helped us with our bags all the way to the 4th floor!, he had great suggestions and always popped in for a chat which we loved. Our room was stunning and the house was immaculate. He allowed us to wash our clothes and use anything in the house whenever we wanted. On our departure he gave us very useful information on the train to köln which helped us so much! The perfect stay! 

P.s visit 'the bird' amazing burger place not too far from Chris and su's house!"

Location is in a very living area with many restaurants and bars. It is also not far from S-Bahn and U-Bahn.
The room is very big, sunny and comfortable and Manja, Frédéric and Jack are very friendly people. 

I would stay again without any hesitation."
436869;36628037;2015-06-29;27769528;Johnny;"I stayed with Manja & Frédéric for a couple of nights over a sunny weekend in Berlin. The room itself was huge in a beautiful old apartment. The room was clean, light and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable.

The apartment is located near to all the trendy bars, restaurants and clubs and everything else Friedrichshain has to offer. With some of the most interesting parts of Berlin just a short walk away. Public transport links are also good with tram and rail stations all nearby.

My hosts were brilliant! Extremely friendly, they always made sure I had everything I could possibly ask for and both speak perfect English. Unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to spend much time with them as I was only there for a short while. However I would definitely have been comfortable chatting away for hours if I had more time!

All in all I couldn’t recommended this place enough, the guys are wonderful and would love to visit again!"
741367;44041156;2015-08-23;3271324;Frank;Fantastic spot.  The room is huge and the apartment is very clean and has a lot of character. One of the coolest neighborhoods in Berlin with lots of cafes but very quiet and relaxing at the same time.  Very close to the metro.  Cyrille is an easy going and friendly host. Highly recommended!

Would recommend to all who want to stay in Kreuzberg and enjoy the bars and cafes, park and close U-Bahn can take you anywhere in Berlin.

12802004;101192081;2016-09-12;15820107;Safae;"overall everything was dirty. he promised to pass by the next day and clean the house but he never did, we stayed four days and he never showed up to clean or send someone else. there was no soap, sponges or any way to keep thing clean while we were there. no curtain in the shower nor some towels to clean up the mess.  we had to do the beds ourselves although he gave us clean sheets. the balcony was full of cigarettes butts. very dirty bathroom and kitchen. and even with just a few item around it felt like a disaster and not because the guest that were there before us. I think the previous guest tried to keep it clean but of course with nothing to clean with was a difficult task.
he was late several times!!! we arrived in the morning to verily but be said that until 3PM he could not meet. ok, no problem, we hung around the area and eat something, at 3pm we headed to the apartment after ten minutes we arrived and rang the bell, no one was there. we were communicating via whatsaap so I sent him a message, reply came after a while, and I did not like his tone, he could not meet until 17pm, I complained and he replied that I could cancel the stay and look for something else (at that time, when the city was fully booked because of a festival) he end up the conversation with be quite and wait. I  don't think that is the way you treat a guest. so, we left again, rent some bicycles with the hustle of having our luggage with us, but we managed, went again to eat and drink something until 18pm to give him time to get ready/arrive/prepare/whateverhewasdoing and we arrived at 18,15pm. rang the bell, no one there. call him, he was on his way, wait again, now in front of the building door. 19pm he arrived. apartment was a mess, unclean (read above). he was very briefly there, gave us the keys and left. 
no amenities, the opposite, we had to buy and bring with us all what we needed and he even got some cleaning product that we could not bring back with us. little responsive and he does not know how to communicate. I had to bite my tongue to maintain my temper. 
little responsive and he does not know how to communicate. 
I had to bite my tongue to maintain my temper. t
he price was in accordance with the listing. 
no amenities and not the most luxurious location but low price. where all the value is lost is at the poor communication and the sanitary conditions of the host and apartment respectively. I think this host needs a review by airbnb staff. overall stay uncomfortable."
12802004;106641273;2016-10-07;22450547;Tasi;Kind of a weird building. We arrived very late and got lost a few times which was not fun. But Salah left keys for us at very short notice and the room was big and the bed was comfortable so it was fine.
12802004;114276522;2016-11-17;8272640;Tomáš;The flat is very well located in Neukölln, very close to S-Bahn and U-Bahn. Thanks to that you could get easily get to city center, Südkreuz station, etc. The room was as expected, pretty cozy and great value for such a price. The only problem was communication. Even though Salah is a kind person and good host, it is complicated to contact him, indeed.

12802004;140354179;2017-03-29;10506983;Olua;Our stay in Salah's apartment was really good! Bed was clean as well as the whole apartment. We didn't find toilet paper in the toilet, but in general everything was fine:)

Hopefully it is available for my next trip to Berlin! :-)"
14085010;91952620;2016-08-07;86067075;Ivar;It was the first time using Airbnb for me and my girlfriend and we are very pleased we were hosted at the apartment of Veronika. The communication was fast and clear and made sure we knew where to go and how to best get there. When arriving at the apartment we were welcomed by a roommate of Veronika. She walked us through the apartment, rules, etc. and made us feel at home immediately. The room itself is very spacious with big windows and the softest bed we have ever slept in. The neighbourhood is very welcoming with lots of green. Great restaurants, coffee places and supermarkets are all walking distance away. Even the centrum is doable by foot where you will walk next to the East Side Gallery, but enough bike renting shops are nearby as well. Also the public transport services are close by and very affordable. Overall we had an amazing experience in Berlin with very friendly hosts!
12888538;100087390;2016-09-07;79372851;Yongjung;Great location and cozy apartment!! This beautiful apartment is right in front of the S-bahn station. Just two stop from Berlin central station and one stop from Alexander platz. And I could go to the museum island and berlin dome by walk. A lot of fancy restaurants are right in front of the apartment. Host Lana is also very kind!!
12888538;114757639;2016-11-20;2082107;Sivan;"We had good time in the apartment. The location is amazing and the apartment itself is quite clean. We were allowed to stay until late in the last day which helped us a lot. 
In the downside, the apartment is actually a 2 bedroom apartment, where the extra bed is actually in the living room, which is located 10m from the railways station. The windows are quite isolated but still. 
The general atmosphere of the apartment is commercial and not cozy which was also a bit of a shame."
12888538;149085108;2017-05-02;34603097;Eric;Great location, restaurants and shopping made this place very convenient to our family, happy we got to stay in the middle of town. This place was clean. Parking was a little difficult but Lana was kind and allowed us to park in her private parking for 15€ per day. I recommend this place for a family or a  couple.
14084194;92354018;2016-08-08;57382982;Paulo André;Lovely room and neighbourhood.
14084194;94296444;2016-08-15;38906802;Ryan;"Mia made me feel very welcome, and also gave me the space I needed.

She gave me very helpful instructions for how to get there from the airport, and didn't mind that I was arriving quite late. She met me at the door, showed me around and got me connected to the wifi.

Everything went very smoothly, and I had everything I needed. The description was accurate and I really like the neighbourhood.

I would happily stay again - thanks for your hospitality Mia :)

The flat is great and the bed is amazingly comfortable! Perfect location for getting round the city, with lots to explore within walking distance. I would definitely stay again!
4072095;41637926;2015-08-08;37580753;Lucia;Die Schlüsselübergabe verlief reibungslos, auch wenn Nataliya persönlich nicht anwesend war. Ihre Vertretung war sehr freundlich zu uns und die Lage der Wohnung an sich war wirklich klasse. Man konnte alles prima erreichen. Da wir zu viert waren, wurde es jedoch ein wenig eng, doch für 5 Tage Berlin war es ertragbar. Auch für Fragen oder Bitten war Nataliyas Vertretung stets offen und erreichbar. Die Wohnung liegt zwar zur Straße, weshalb es teilweise etwas lauter wurde, jedoch konnte man trotzdem gut schlafen. Alles in allem für das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis eine gute Wahl.
4072095;80731167;2016-06-19;75034211;Ahjanae;Nataylia and her husband are very nice people and welcoming too! They let us know where the nearest stores were and provided us with plenty blankets and made it really comfortable! I enjoyed how close it was to the major shopping areas and the price of the space is extremely reasonable. We would love to stay here anytime!
4072095;131881019;2017-02-14;5176127;Julie;"Nataliya and her sister (who was checking us in to the apartment) was very sweet and open. The area was very nice and central to everything! 
We had some problems with the drain which was clogged every time we took a shower, and the water couldn't always get hot... Because of the fact that we were 4 people living there, it was a bit problematic that there was only one key. So maybe the apartment is better for a family who always go together. 
Overall it was a nice experience staying at the (very pink!) apartment, and Natalyas sister was very quick to come with more lined for the bed (we said we were going to be 4 people, but there was only lined for 3)."
4072095;141445903;2017-04-03;13390718;Danae;"Die Lage der Wohnung ist super! Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt (die Pinke Wand existiert auch nicht mehr)
War alles da, brauchten nix zusätzlich zu besorgen.
Einziges Manko, das Wasser war zwischenzeitlich etwas kalt und das Wasser wollte nicht so schnell abfließen. Ansonsten war alles Prima :)"

3936899;51503623;2015-10-20;20577489;Marin;Solvig was very helpful in arranging everything for us, even though we just booked a day in advance and traveled with 2 small children. Her parents were also very helpful, and they reacted quickly to any extra requests. The area was great with lots of cafes, restaurants and playgrounds, and with a major S-bahn/U-bahn station closeby. The apartment was spacious, the bed was large, and the couch can easily fit two children or even two small adults. My only issue was that the apartment was a bit cluttered, but it just depends what you are used to.
15110440;105540643;2016-10-02;49468817;Claire;We had a wonderful stay. Aga and Flo were really helpful with recommendations in the area. It's a great location.

The apartment itself is comfortable, spacious and quiet, at a great, central location close to public transportation and a variety of restaurants. I had fast internet and everything else that I needed. Thanks Christine!"
6477991;37259064;2015-07-05;33088159;Matthew;Rike's place was amazing. More charming than the pictures could do justice and right in the heart of Kreuzberg. Rike herself was very helpful and made us feel very at home. A very positive airbnb experience!

13071894;84421783;2016-07-07;17710553;Signe;We can warmly recommend Frank and Joannas room to other travelers! When we arrived at the apartment Anita, Franks girlfriend, Joannas, sister, greeted us. She showed us the apartment and asked if we had any questions. Frank and Joanna had printed af thorough guide to the apartment and the surrounding area as well. At the dining table there was a basket of maps and some chocolates and a beer for each of us, which was a very nice welcoming gesture! We loved staying in their room and they have a really nice roomie, Lisa, whom we just met once on the stairs. As an addition we loved the fox theme and the color coordinated towels :D Next time we will be going to Berlin we will stay at Frank and Joannas place if it is available! Insidertip: We rented bikes at a place called M'eierrad placed at Blücherstraße 20 - it costs 3€ per day compared to about 10-12€ at other bike rentals. We parked in Frank and Joannas closed back yard.

The shower had great water pressure, the bed was big n comfy and the balcony was a welcomed luxury. The location was super close to the underground which we used constantly, (they stop at 1 FYI). We enjoyed the organic shop n bakery just two doors down. Highly recommend. Thank you Tani. Till next time!

Ps. Park Plaza around the corner has wifi which we used when needed."

176355;2051688;2012-08-21;2171977;Vera;Located in the courtyard of a listed building in the heart of Berlin, this thoughtfully appointed apartment provides all the amenities required for a pleasant stay. It is an aesthetically very pleasing space with wooden floors, partially exposed brick walls, simple yet tasteful wooden furniture and gorgeous bathrooms, all of which brings out the character of this 1896  building. The owners payed great attention to detail - each guest receives a set of towels in a different colour, the selection of CDs carefully tries to accommodate all tastes, there was even a bar of good-quality chocolate to greet us. The interior works in ecologically friendly and energy-efficient ways. The location is quiet yet conveniently close to all the important historical sites. We greatly enjoyed our stay and I now cannot imagine why one would want to stay anywhere else. And should you forget something upon departure as I did the owner will make sure to get it to you. Very highly recommended.

14872272;144198212;2017-04-15;14650327;Alain;emplacement central proche du métro STADTMITTE et à 500 métres de Charlie Point. L'appartement se résume à 3 chambres, une petite cuisine (nous étions 5 mais il n'y avait que 3 chaises), l'équipement est modeste. Il n'y a pas de salon (la photo du canapé vue sur le site est en fait une photo d'une des chambres).Bonne disponibilité de jény qui nous a aussi permis de quitter l'appartement plus tard que l'heure de départ officielle.
11966268;70595318;2016-04-18;11631738;Cornelis;A wonderful place. From the beginning we were very welcome. Martin is a great host. We slept in a great room with a balcony overlooking the street in a beautiful appartment in one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Berlin. We would DEFINITELY return here.
11504559;79545403;2016-06-13;14270834;Aglaia;"We had a great time staying at Elisa and Mario's place.
They gave us a warm welcome, the atmosphere was relaxed and we felt we could come and go as we pleased. 
Going out at night and coming home late was ok since they did as well :) 
The neighbourhood is cool, multicultural, with a lot of fun strolls and places to eat and drink. For fancy stuff it's better to head to another neighbourhood."
11504559;100277062;2016-09-08;3658042;Ariel;"Elisa is a super caring and fun host. Her apartmant is well located, clean and cosy and you can place your laptop on the kitchen table and work there in tbe sun. Elisa went out of her way at least twice to make our stay enjoyable not to mention her amazing tips and friendly open approach. In Summary: highly recommended airbnb in Berlin [ but only for awesome guests ;-) ]."
11504559;115837207;2016-11-27;31842071;Isabella;I actually did not get to meet Elisa as we both had a very busy weekend, but we did exchange many messages and my boyfriend met her - and she is very kind and welcoming. The apartment is well located and walking distance to restaurants, drinks, cafe's etc. and also easy to take public transport. You have everything you need, and the bed was very comfortable. In simple words - good value for money and a kind host.
11504559;138520401;2017-03-20;17227648;Sabrina;great place for a great value
10580604;62430660;2016-02-14;19308275;Hannah;I felt incredibly welcomed! Cynthia and Michael took extensive time to explain everything about the (incredibly beautiful) flat to me. I felt so at home and comfortable it was great.
3560310;19209549;2014-09-08;19072182;Ian;Paul greeted us after waiting with his charming son. He was very helpful to get us oriented in Berlin and suggest some spot for food and fun before leaving is in privacy. The apartment was modern and comfortable for our weeklong stay. And in the perfect location.
3560310;23523415;2014-12-03;21852186;Carlos;"The place was amazing. Very spacious and comfortable. 

Location was also very good, near the U-Bahn and in a neighborhood packed with options.

Paul was incredible and even sat with me to teach a lot about the city.

Honestly, the experience was incredible."
3560310;25505461;2015-01-18;15122617;Katharina;Everything was fine! The apartment was very clean and the key handover went as arranged. And we also liked the area, close to shopping, metro, parc, etc. Paul is very anxious in making your stay comfortable! Thank you!
3560310;52090604;2015-10-26;2542905;Gabriel;Wir können die Mini-Loft von Paul nur weiterempfehlen! Netter Kontakt, tolle Wohnung und eine super Lage.
3560310;60276180;2016-01-21;23540439;Chloé;Nous avons passé 4 jours dans l'appartement de Paul. Tout est conforme aux photos, beau studio. L'appartement est très bien placé, aucun soucis pour trouver un supermarché ou une bouche du métro. D'ailleurs quelques minutes suffisent pour se rendre dans l'hypercentre de Berlin. Super séjour, nous le recommandons.
1429701;52053174;2015-10-26;18888520;Monica;We had an amazing stay in the boat. The boat is just perfect, beautifully decorated with  everything you can think of to make your staying ultra comfortable. The host had a bottle of wine, beer, milk and biscuit for us on arrival. We also got vouchers for a yummy free breakfast..Little touches that make the staying more special..the boat is very private and quiet, situated in a very safe neighbour hood only a stroll away from all the main touristy attractions and city centre. I'll definitely recommend this place to anyone and I'd go back there again myself!
1429701;55186133;2015-11-29;24396649;Johannes;"It really is a charming houseboat and it made our trip to Amsterdam so special. We had a couple of rainy days, well just sit in the captains cabin, drink a coffee (which is provided), watch out of the windows and read a book. I recommend Moby Dick, cause it really feels like you are captain Ahab on this boat...

Ayla and Jake are lovely people and we will defenetly come back. Everything was nice arranged, breakfast vouchers, a bottle of wine was waiting for us...

Thank you"
1429701;57441216;2015-12-26;45213354;Thomas;"Best experience I had whit airbnb.
Ayla & Jake are great - their boat is great!"
1429701;58021461;2015-12-31;26942123;Carol;Lovely stay, very welcoming hosts who were happy to help make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Houseboat is on a lovely, quiet dock/street. Easy walking to central Amsterdam. Definitely recommend.
1429701;59203982;2016-01-08;47301841;Samantha;"The most cosy place I have ever stayed in! We enjoyed our trip immensely, especially since it was so close to Centraal. Hosts were very gracious and welcoming. I will recommend this place to anyone going to the city and hope to have an opportunity to return myself!
P. S. Guests: Try the hot chocolate at the bagel place. Best hot chocolate anywhere!"
1429701;62492662;2016-02-15;21055223;Em;We just managed a quick trip to Amsterdam and the weather wasn't great. But Jake and Ayla's cozy houseboat more than compensated. They are fantastic hosts, on hand when needed and they left some really nice touches around the place. The houseboat is in a brilliant location and even though I was 5 months pregnant we were close enough to the centre to be able to walk everywhere.
1429701;77778656;2016-06-03;26538093;Steve;"Ayla and Jake are so fantastic, and their canal boat is a dream. Such a wonderful stay. They think of everything and their hospitality can't be beat. The space is super clean and so incredibly charming. And, the location is so perfect; so accessible to everything. I will never consider staying anywhere else next time in Amsterdam."
1429701;78414387;2016-06-06;21102175;Jay;Absolutely perfect. There is nothing else I can add to all of the other reviews. Absolutely perfect.
1429701;80138544;2016-06-16;253134;Ayden;"I've stayed in some great AirBnBs in my time, but Ayla and Jake's takes the cake. The houseboat was beautiful and comfortable; the hosts were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and generous (leaving us great wine, beer, and chocolate!); and the location was fabulous. I can't wait to stay here again when I return to Amsterdam- hopefully very soon."
1429701;102784968;2016-09-19;8606460;Michael;"Jack & Ayla's boat is pure magic. it's in the best location, close to everything but in a quiet spot. their breakfast coupon for the close by cafe is the best to start a day of Strolling in the lovely streets and canals of the city. the privecy of the b&b will give you all the tranquility you want but the closenes to Jack and Ayla's part of the boat will insure you'l always have a close by local to give a tip or guidence to the city's Secrets.
a most recomended"
1429701;123037953;2016-12-27;5704091;Rachael;"Ayla and Jake were fantastic hosts!  The boat is very close to the city center, so its a very easy walk, but still quiet and out of the way. They provided us with a number of awesome recommendations and made us really feel at home.  If you are looking for a unique experience in Amsterdam, stay here!! Its truly incredible. 

Thank you Ayla and Jake for having us!"
1429701;125140448;2017-01-04;16396898;Kevin;Great place to stay in a safe part of town.  Very romantic and cozy boat (even in winter).

It was definitely the highlight of our 4 week trip to Europe. Everything about the boat was perfect with wonderful hospitality and the best restaurant suggestions :)
We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam."

It was nice to walk from the house to the center. Many restaurants and bars closed to the flat.
We love the design of the flat and the beautiful sunset front of the window...enjoyed the sofa for relax after more then 20 km by walk around Amsterdam!!
Sophie and Rutger are very nice hosts and they helped us in any request...a special thanks for your hospitality and for your tips about the restaurants...we discovered the seafood bar!!! Delicious fish restaurant one on my favorite in the world!!! See you next time

It's a calm and modern area really close to city center with the tramway. I would definitely recomend Flavio's place !
Thank you :)"
7332860;42038289;2015-08-10;19405;Lisa;Flávio was very kind, hospitable, and accommodating from the first moment we said hello! A pleasure to stay in his flat in an interesting area of Amsterdam, east of all the typical activities of the center.
7332860;42430657;2015-08-13;38452810;Madline;I can absolutely recommend this place. It's close to the city center and the tram stops directly in front of the house. Flàvio is very friedly and helpful. We had a great stay.

Living in IJBurg may bring you to another side of Amsterdam, which is the new land. He is amiable in person, and his place is very convenient & comfy! Recommended for others to stay.

Tram is quite near so it's easy to reach there from central Amsterdam. The kitchen and bathroom was always clean, although I didn't cook anything, it's an ideal place to do so.
7332860;56790067;2015-12-18;3048879;Andrea;Flávio was communicative and helpful and pleasant. Our stay with him was short. We arrived late and left early in the morning. The apartment met our needs and was tidy. Thanks, Flávio!

7332860;60933208;2016-01-29;42000745;Jascha;Flavio is a really nice host, always joking around and willing to help. My girlfriend and I felt really welcome. We were there end of January, which is not the best of seasons. Maybe the host could adjust his price according to the seasons (just a suggestion).
7332860;64273439;2016-03-01;4478006;Jaclyn;Fantastic place, fantastic host... Highly recommend! This place looks exactly like the photos.

593101;92379247;2016-08-08;71923133;Angelo;"Se avete intenzione di visitare Amsterdam spendendo poco questa è la casa che fa per voi!
Abitazione a 15-20 minuti a piedi dalla stazione dei treni, con supermercato e fermata del tram a 150 metri!
La casa, disposta su due piani, ci è risultata più grande di quanto ci aspettassimo! Cucina, sala e camere da letto soddisfacenti e il quartiere è molto tranquillo!
L'unica pecca è il bagno al piano primo che risulta davvero piccolo ma che comunque fa il suo dovere!
Ringraziamo Safinaz che pur essendo in vacanza ha fatto in modo di farci trovare la casa pronta prima del check-in previsto!

It is perfectly located in the Old City, nearby the Central Station, in a quite neighbourhood with a nice view upon the Canal.

Living at the boat was funny,  my kids loved to discover the boat and were very excited. Annique let you a full equipped house (She and her family lives there when there are no guests) the location is near to the center, you can reach it easily by tramway, bike or even by foot... in sunny days ;) Amsterdam is not friendly with cars so we had to park some far from the house and take the tramway to come back to the house. I would have liked to be in a warmer season as the boat is a little fresh by night. Overall was an excellent experience."
3809292;34466166;2015-06-08;18444391;Abhijit;Stayed over at Merel's apartment while she was away. Alexander who was there to welcome us was a great help and gave us a quick lowdown on Amsterdam. The apartment itself is located in the Pijp which is quite cool and fairly close to the center. Bars, stores, open air market etc all close by and a supermarket in the building itself. Nice bar across the street. It's a lovely cosy apartment decorated very nicely and very practical. My wife and I had a lovely time here and it proved to be the perfect base to explore Amsterdam from and return to after long crazy nights!!

Je recommande cet appartement pour les couples ! Merci Merel, Maxime
3809292;48927577;2015-09-29;7832881;Steven;Merel's apartment is very cosy - exactly as in the photographs - and in a cool part of town. There are loads of really great bars, cafes and restaurants nearby, the tram stops practically outside the door, and the Rijkmuseum is a 10-minute walk away. Merel was very helpful every step of the way - the process couldn't have been easier. Recommended.
2134950;17769130;2014-08-17;16594803;Kendyl;"Marilene met me at the entrance to the apartment and showed me in and around, explaining where everything was. The apartment is fantastic, a beautiful mix of old character and charm with a fresh renovation and lovely modern bathroom (good shower too). It was also very clean. The beds are extremely comfortable, even the mattresses in the loft (which is so charming). My friends and I took turns sleeping in different spots, so I can vouch for this! The street is beautiful and also very peaceful, and the house is located in a great ""non-touristy"" area, so there are good restaurants and bars around. It is very close to the Rijksmuseum also, and we managed to walk to pretty much everything we wanted to see and do (keep in mind, we were not interested so much in the red light district etc, which is located abit further away...) It is also pretty close to two tram stops. Marilene was attentive, easy-going and friendly, and Ernst was also nice although I met him only briefly on the front steps! I would recommend this apartment to anyone, it is a real gem."

2134950;75692209;2016-05-22;20365176;Jess;Ernst was fabulous and stayed up late to welcome us at midnight, which was much later than I had expected. The apartment is in immaculate condition. My daughters loved sleeping up in the loft area, which was like a special camp for them. The double bed is also super comfortable, and everything we could have wanted was provided including fresh towels and coffee and waffles. The house is in a quiet area, with bars and restaurants only a few streets away. I would highly recommend this apartment to anybody who is thinking about staying in Amsterdam, particularly if you are looking for somewhere tranquil and in perfect order.
2134950;81888238;2016-06-25;37669367;Lucile;Le logement est parfaitement conforme à la description, il peut accueillir jusque à 4 personnes. Le coin cuisine est très pratique, équipé d'un petit frigo, d'un four, d'un micro-onde, grille pain ... Contrairement à ce qui est indiqué dans la description le wifi fonctionne impeccablement. En plus d’être bien situé à 5min du tramway, l'appartement est dans une rue extrêmement calme, on entend le chant des oiseaux. Cela donne l'impression de vivre en plein cœur d'Amsterdam comme le locaux. Les hôtes étaient très gentils plein de petites attentions et de conseils pour les visites.
2134950;96943711;2016-08-25;88041120;B;We had a great couple days here and the apartment was spacious enough for my two friends and I. Both the neighborhood and the apartment had a lot of character which was very nice and was both close and far enough from the busier/touristy parts of town. Overall, a very enjoyable stay.

We had a nice stay at Janneke's.
The only drawback: It's fairly noisy from the busy street."
325165;75891431;2016-05-23;70149216;Lisa;"Mein Freund und ich haben 4 Tage in Amsterdam verbracht. Jannekes Apartment ist wirklich wunderschön. Klein, gemütlich und schön eingerichtet. Perfekt für eine Reise zu zweit.
Die Anbindung ins Zentrum ist super, man kann vor der Haustür direkt mit der Tram fahren, mit dem Fahrrad oder auch laufen. 
Janneke war sehr freundlich, obwohl wir schon super früh angekommen sind. 
Ich kann Ihr Apartment nur empfehlen!

L'appartement est très bien situé, seulement à quelques minutes à pieds du centre, proche du métro et de la gare. Il est très agréable, spacieux et lumineux.
L'endroit est très calme donnant sur une rue piétonne, et facile d'accès. 
Il y a deux chats mignons pour nous tenir compagnie !
Julia est très sympathique, et nous la remercions pour son accueil très chaleureux. Tout était parfait !"
8024854;73301339;2016-05-08;35492860;Erin;My friends and I had a wonderful experience staying here. While we didn't meet Rochelle and Thijis, they left us with several contacts who made sure that we had a great stay. The apartment was clean and perfect for our needs. Yes, the stairs are quite steep and daunting (but really only when you have too much luggage). The area was close to everything we wanted to see. There were also a great many restaurants (yay Jackets!) close by. Oh, and many thanks for the bottle of wine!
8024854;83777552;2016-07-04;79754453;Maria;"We booked our trip just a few days before we left. However despite lack of planning, our host had all the information we needed to have a great holiday.  The welcome packet was quite informative including places to see. We did not even had time to buy a guide book which at the end we did not need. 

The apartment was clean, modern and very comfortable. There were 3 of us and the pullout couch was very comfortable. 

Location is close to most places including restaurants, museums and shops. There is also the tram close by as well.  Food Hallen is a good hangout place 2 blocks away. And there is a farmers market 3 blocks away.  

One pain point was the stair case which was quite steep and narrow.  It was quite a challenge to bring down our big luggage."
1921050;69141845;2016-04-09;42414259;Sarah;"This was the Best Airbnb I have ever seen! The Location was truly Incredible! It was 5 minute walk from the Central Station and so easy to get to with our luggage. The Canal house was VERY clean and wonderful decor! It is a huge house and we got the room facing the canal! This was wonderful! The location was so great for sightseeing and Max our host even left us Dutch Stroopwafels as a welcome gift! It was so thoughtful of him!
We loved the location, the room, and our private bathroom right next to the room. The room was very large and the bed was very comfortable. We had our own key which made entry throughout the trip awesome. I have nothing but good things to say about this airbnb. Thank you to Max our host for a wonderful stay! I would highly recommend this airbnb in Amsterdam!"
8382934;51981002;2015-10-25;15922046;Louise;The apartment is lovely and in a great location! Very easy to find and close to the train station. There is no oven in the apartment and there was no spare toilet roll or soap in the bathroom so we had to buy our own, but other than that it was great! Would definitely stay there again.
8382934;57231745;2015-12-23;31841950;Léa;"Ce logement est parfaitement situé, dans une rue très commercante, en plein milieu du quartier rouge. Il est facile de visiter Amsterdam à pied, et d'acceder à de nombreux restaurants/bars. L'appartement est très propre, et ressemble totalement à la description faites via les photos et commentaires de l'annonce.
Je recommande vivement ce logement."
693675;13306115;2014-05-25;12769944;Yurii;"Susanne is a great host, she has provided us with  all necessary support. Her place is in a lovely typical holland style, with narrow staircases and vintage look. The room has nice small balcony and access to the bathroom which is shared with the family. The apartment is situated in a very quiet neighbourhood. All in all very nice and clean place.
Thanks very much for your hospitality!"
1266433;7883915;2013-10-07;4973759;Ruben;Sander and his wife welcomed us very warmly and gave us much advice on visiting the city. The flat is ideally situated and comfortable. The terrace is great for breakfast. Very nice place to stay to enjoy Amsterdam.
1266433;13814246;2014-06-05;13241222;Jonathan;Both Sander and his wife welcomed us (couple), and were kind, thoughtful hosts. The location was ideal -- less than a block off a great tram spot, great neighborhood and walking distance to everything central. The Library was very clean, had all the basics we needed, and struck a great balance between privacy and having a local host. My wife and I felt fortunate to have stayed, and highly recommend for the location, price, and hosts.
1266433;17837422;2014-08-18;12935330;Mark;"We had the best time staying in Sander's Library Room. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed. He kindly took us through a map of things to see and do, and gave us some restaurant recommendations - so great to get a local's perspective! We visited two of his recommended restaurants and were not disappointed. The food was excellent! 
The location of the accommodation is great, right on one of the canals, and is within walking distance to everything! The room is very comfortable, great bed, shower etc... Everything you could possibly need for a short stay, plus the separate entrance means you aren't disturbing anyone upstairs. We absolutely loved our (short) time in Amsterdam and would not hesitate to recommend The Library to anyone who is considering it! Thank you again."
1266433;18486351;2014-08-27;18891083;Zane;"This was my first city, in my first trip (ever) to Europe. Needless to say, I was very excited but also a little nervous. Sander was absolutely great. He was communicative before my arrival, and welcomed me personally! He also took a few minutes to give me a map overview of where all the great places to visit were (both touristy, and great local eating spots).

I thought the room was fantastic. It's everything you'd need, whether in Europe or America, even if you're only slightly practical. 

I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Amsterdam, for a centrally located, accessible, and above adequate room."
1266433;20612152;2014-10-02;20779004;Nistasha;"Adorably cute room in an amazing neighborhood. Easy to navigate to and from Amsterdam Central and walking distance to museums, shopping, and restaurants. Sander and his wife do a great job making you feel welcome to their place and the city. They offer a lot of great tips regarding the city. 

The Library makes its name proud, with the owners having a large and quirky set of books that are great to look through after being out and about all day. Or there's a TV with lots of English channels with Dutch subtitles."
1266433;21868174;2014-10-26;828529;Melodie;"Xander and Marijke were super friendly and welcoming to us. They communicated the directions to the ""library"" from the airport and we used the train and tram option and didn't get lost. Xander has a stack of information about Amsterdam with maps and tips on where to go, how to get there etc... The ""library"" is a kind of granny flat down from the main apartment. It was very quiet, clean and tidy and in a great location. The wifi, fridge, TV, hair dryer and heaters all worked well. I would definitely recommend this property for a stay in Amsterdam."
1266433;22442465;2014-11-06;1580596;Nicolas;"Sander and his wife are wonderful people. Very kind and interesting.
They received me very nicely with a glass of wine, we discussed a bit and the day after I even came to take a coffee with them before leaving. 
The library is perfect, exactly like on the pictures!!!

Thanks again and see you soon!!!!"
1266433;22868562;2014-11-16;4178245;Marian;Great place to stay in central Amsterdam. Spacious room in a beautiful house. Sander is a great host, who welcomed us with a drink and gave us lots of tips on things to do. Unfortunately we didn't had a lot of time to spend in Amsterdam, so a good excuse to return. Will definitely stay at 'the Library' again then!
1266433;24710166;2015-01-02;21812677;Alberto;Todo perfecto, apartamento muy limpio y cómodo, los anfitriones muy amables y colaboradores para hacer la estancia mas agradable.
1266433;24842948;2015-01-03;6438137;Markus;sander and marijke are very nice host who know how to welcome a guest and make him feel at home. the appartment was nice, cozy and clean - and the place is superclose to everything!
1266433;27208919;2015-02-28;25671036;Jim;"Sander and Marijke were awesome hosts.  They were very welcoming when we arrived and allowed us to check-in early due to our early flight arrival.  Their advice for places to visit during our stay was perfect.

The room was exactly as described, very clean and perfectly equipped.  Very cool selection of books to browse through during down time.  We would definitely stay here again."
1266433;28736517;2015-03-29;10235970;Christine;"The Apartment - comfortable, clean, quiet, private.  The flat also has a personal entrance which is wonderful.  The location is superb being within walking distance to shops, museums and restaurants.  The bed is comfy and the patio is great (even though it was raining and we didn't use it!).  

The Hosts - Sander and Marijke are so kind and fantastic hosts!  Upon our arrival, they generously spent time telling us about their great city complete with recommendations, tips and a map of suggestions to make the most out of our trip.  Sander's communication throughout the booking process was also unparalleled.

I absolutely recommend this listing and would definitely stay at The Library again should my travels take me to Amsterdam!"
1266433;29048654;2015-04-03;14769582;Brian;Sander was a very welcoming host and gave us a ton of recommendations for Amsterdam, I wish I could have stayed longer.  The whole arrangement was perfect.
1266433;29574728;2015-04-09;9650975;Rebecca;The library was great. A fab location, really comfy and super friendly, informative hosts. Couldn't really ask for more!
1266433;33991303;2015-06-03;21948203;Wolfgang;Sander is simply the role model of a perfect host. Many guests wrote about it before and I just can confirm. The location is in the heart of Amsterdam. Everything is in walking distance. When I got sick Sander helped me as much as possible and I really felt like being at home. Highly recommended!
1266433;34199155;2015-06-06;16110770;Brian;"Sander helped us quite a bit prior to arriving as he guided us through the different parking options in Amsterdam, which is not an easy place to have a rental car. We eventually settled on the P+R park and ride option and were able to park for only 1 euro per day with an easy 20 minute ride on public transportation into the city. It is kind of a complicated process but worth the savings. 

Once we arrived at the apartment Sander greeted us with a couple Grolsch beers, which were nice after our drive, and gave us a very thorough review of some of the top sights of the city and some good restaurants and bars to check out. He did this on a map of Amsterdam that he then gave us and we used throughout our two days on the trip. 

The apartment itself was nice. It was not huge but certainly comfortable for two people even with some very large luggage. There is an outdoor courtyard that is very nice as well that you have access to. The location was great and you are within walking distance of all the main sights of Amsterdam.

The only minor complaint was that the internet was acting up while we were there. I had to go upstairs to turn off/on the wifi amplifier to get it to start working again a couple times. This did work however and was just a minor inconvenience."
1266433;36119302;2015-06-25;34544174;Noah;Sander and Marijke are the perfect Airbnb hosts. They talked to us for an hour and a half when we arrived as it was our first time in Amsterdam. They gave us a map with 10 points of interest and they were willing to answer questions about everything. Their house is in a perfect location, it's clean, and has all the amenities you need. We could not have found a better place to stay in Amsterdam.
1266433;41334968;2015-08-07;32152801;Tess;My boyfriend and I loved staying at the library with Sander as our host. He was completely welcoming and couldn't have done more to help us enjoy our stay in Amsterdam. The room is pretty true to the images provided and Sander respected our privacy throughout. I honestly don't have one complaint about my stay in the library and would definitely recommend it!
1266433;41925772;2015-08-10;11811885;Catalina;We stayed 3 nights at the library and it was one of our best experience of Airbnb. First of all Sander and Marijke are very welcoming. At our arrival they gave us a map of Amsterdam and explained us everything we must see during our trip. The library is exactly what it looks like on pictures. A perfect place in the center of Amsterdam. You can go everywhere by walking, its in a Nice neighborhoud and easy to find when we arrived from the airport. I totaly recommend the library and i Will go back if i travel again in Amsterdam !
1266433;43651048;2015-08-21;27317101;Jacqui;My boyfriend and I were doing a quick road trip throughout Western Europe, 12 days, 9 cities and more in between that. While we were only in Amsterdam for one night and one day, Sander and Marijke made sure we took advantage of every second we had. As soon as we got there, we had a beer and a nice chat with them, and they told us all of the places that we should hit. We were able to do all of them! They were also very helpful with telling us where we could park the car and how to get to the apartment. And the room was beautiful - very private with its own entrance and everything. I wish we could have spent more than one night there because I absolutely loved it. Thank you for being such great hosts! We'll definitely be back :)
1266433;47244261;2015-09-17;8992106;Susan;"Sander and Marijke could not have been more gracious and generous with their time and advice. They know their City well, and helped us plan our visit to make best use of the short time we had in Amsterdam. 
Their guest studio, ""The Library"", is light-filled and immaculate, with a connecting private patio space, and a corner set up with refrigerator and coffee supplies.  
They are located in the center of Amsterdam, an easy walk all the City has to offer. We highly recommend them."
1266433;71599874;2016-04-26;4301893;Federico;Muy lindo departamento con una biblioteca impresionante! Excelente para pasar unos dias en Amsterdam! Recomendable 100%
1266433;79364440;2016-06-12;60773286;Melissa;"Sander and Maryke were fantastic hosts that made us feel very welcome at the Library. The location was great - very central and not too difficult to find and in a beautiful building on the canal. 

Sander gave us a lot of helpful tips on where to go and how to get around on the train. I felt like I had a bit of an insider's guide to Amsterdam which was fantastic.

The Library is a great place to stay for a short break in Amsterdam!"
1266433;84502640;2016-07-07;38010251;Greg;Although a very short one night stay in Amsterdam during our travels throughout Europe, we couldn't have picked a better spot. We were greeted, given the keys and given recommendations. The hosts made it clear that if we needed anything we simply holler. Although we would have liked to stay for longer, we will surely be back and keep this place in mind for a longer stay.
1266433;94652516;2016-08-16;5948625;Ka;Very cozy room in a great location. Sander was very welcoming and polite. The room has a separate exit so it's very private.
1025482;22063734;2014-10-29;20529966;Werner;Reinhart was welcoming and helping, a perfect host. We loved the interior and felt very comfortable. Living on the water and enjoying our breakfast watching ducks and swans swimming by was a wonderful experience.
1025482;22980915;2014-11-19;2891571;Anna;Reinhart's houseboat is in a lovely secluded location only minutes from the centre of Amsterdam via the 24 hour free ferry service. Everything is clean, warm and welcoming and Reinhart is a laid back and helpful host who makes an excellent breakfast. The bed is very comfortable and the view from the window is lovely to start the day with. We also very much enjoyed the company of Reinhart's cat. We would definitely stay with Reinhart on future trips to  Amsterdam, and we will be recommending his boat to all of our friends.
1025482;26156541;2015-02-05;20181233;Markus;Wir waren für drei Übernachtungen bei Reinhart und ich muss sagen, es war ganz wunderbar. Reinhart ist ein toller und sehr angenehmer Gastgeber, welcher Interesse an seinen Gästen zeigt und sich dabei aber nicht aufdrängt. Die Unterkunft ist wie im Inserat beschrieben und lässt keine Wünsche offen. Die Wege ins Zentrum ist kurz und zu Fuss machbar. Sogar Frühstück gibt es bei ihm, dass hatte ich bisher so noch nicht. Ich kann Reinhart somit uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen.
1025482;26908653;2015-02-22;16456352;Nicolas;Superbe week-end dans ce charmant houseboat très confortable. L'accueil de Reynard était parfait : présent pour nous conseiller tout en respectant notre intimité. Enfin son petit déjeuner, un régal ! Encore merci !
1025482;27423937;2015-03-04;8091542;Stephanie;Wir haben 2 Tage bei Reinhart übernachtet und es war richtig toll. Das Hausboot ist schnell vom Hauptbahnhof erreichbar und Reinhart hat uns super Tipps für die Stadt gegeben. Wir hatten eine schöne Zeit und würden das Hausboot absolut weiter empfehlen.
1025482;31514817;2015-05-06;28694896;Rosemarie;"My daughter of 15 years and myself have spent 4 nights on Reinhart's houseboat - it was a very nice experience! Thanks to the location of the houseboat on the north side of the north sea canal, we have discovered a part of Amsterdam we would never have visited otherwise. We took the free ferry every day to travel to the city center as hundreds of inhabitants of Amsterdam do, thus experiencing a part of the Amsterdam daily life and routine. The surroundings of the houseboat are agreeable and calm, while the trip to the city center only takes about 10 to 15 minutes (walking to the ferry and crossing over). 
Our room was nice and calm and we enjoyed the daily breakfast Reinhart prepared for us. He was a kind and attentive host, giving advice when asked and otherwise respecting his guests' space and intimacy. 
All in all, this was a charming and enriching addition to our stay in Amsterdam! 
Thank you, Reinhart!"
1025482;33493349;2015-05-29;26716818;Anthony;"As this was the first time we had ever used Airbnb, we were a little unsure what it would be like compared to staying in a hotel. Have to say though after staying at Reinharts houseboat we loved every minute of it. Reinhart is a fantastic host. He had breakfast ready for us every morning, he was friendly and alot of the time he was out so it felt as though we had the houseboat to ourselves. The houseboat itself was a wonderful experience and something we would love to do if we come back to Amsterdam in the future. 

Anth & Sou."
1025482;44310689;2015-08-25;6855509;Lisa;Reinharts Houseboat is a very nice and quiet place to stay in Amsterdam. He is a kind host and the room in the boat is beautiful. The location is perfect, with the free ferry you reach central station in less than five minutes. Reinhart prepares breakfast for you at the time you prefer. I would definitely come back to this place.
1025482;53462578;2015-11-09;42700696;Valentina;This houseboat is the perfect way to enjoy Amsterdam, the location is very quiet and close to the center. The room is very large and comfortable and has a really nice view. Gorgeous view also from the living room. We enjoyed our breakfast and our staying in the houseboat, everything was perfect. Great experience!
1025482;54580017;2015-11-22;10117429;Dong-Yeon;"The boat house is beautiful and clean as it appears to be in the photos. Was also very quiet, you can hear many different types of birds singing day and and night. The ferry that connects Amsterdam Centraal station and the neighborhood of the boat house was free, quick (less than 2 mins), and very frequent. Reinhart made us nice breakfast during the stay, that helped us go through the day fully energised.

Was a totally new experience to stay on a boat house - definitely something to experience while travelling Amsterdam. :)"
1025482;74548142;2016-05-15;47236058;Marie-Caroline;"Notre Voyage s'est très bien passé, Reinhart était un hôte charmant, présent mais sans trop l'être. 
La péniche est parfaitement conforme aux photos et le cadre était très agréable."
1025482;110027771;2016-10-23;17587889;Kenneth;A beautiful place, ideal for enjoying Amsterdam. Reinhart was really welcoming, and made us enjoy our stay. The houseboat was fantastic, and the neighborhood quiet, but still close to the centrum.
15574525;123009620;2016-12-27;35889746;Marieke;I just stayed with Mathius for one night.  I was hardly there, so I felt sorry having to skip his famous breakfast. The room is fine and comfortable and the apartment is easy to reach. Mathius was very friendly and helpful.

1952614;9608688;2014-01-03;10421100;Mymy;"We stayed at Coen's place for 5 days from the 28th of December till January the 2nd to spend new year eve in Amsterdam.
Coen's apartment is very well located in the pijp which is full of shops, restaurants and all you may need just at walking distance.
There are buses and 3 lines of tramways that takes you to the center very quickly.
In the apartment, you will find everything you need and the owner and his friends are really easy to contact in case you need. 
The kitchen is so well furnished, that will make you feel like home if you like to cook!
I will definitely book the location if I spend another few days in dam.
That was our first experience in Amsterdam and we have to say that the place played a major role for our comfort.
Thanks again Coen for everything"

9058595;55325400;2015-11-29;25613326;Nicole;"We were Yassien's first guests and our stay was wonderful! Yassien was very communicative and eager to make our stay comfortable. He was very accommodating to our early arrival, and always very quick to respond and gave us some great tips. 

The apartment is just as pictured. Large and clean, with a very comfortable bed. There are great views out of the large front windows, and a cute little balcony in the back that is probably very pleasant in nicer weather (our stay was fairly cold and rainy). 

The location of the apartment could not have been better. It is in a more resent oak area of Amsterdam, but only a 15min walk to Centraal Station and a 5min walk to Harlemerstraat. There are a lot of restaurants and cafes around (including a fantastic Indian restaurant), but the apartment itself stayed very quiet. On Saturdays there is a great market right outside your doorstep! Lots of food and craft vendors, definitely worth checking out. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay, and will definitely be back next time we are in Amsterdam."
9058595;56556019;2015-12-14;4311742;Emily;We had a great time in Yassien's apartment - the place was nice, clean and exactly as pictured. The neighbourhood was lovely, and the apartment perfectly situated for exploring. Yassien himself went out of his way to answer emails immediately and helpfully, and even let us leave our suitcases after we'd checked out - all in all a great host.
9058595;56954899;2015-12-20;46128921;Stacy;Beautiful apartment! It was very nice and clean! The location is nice as well! We woke up in the morning to a market outside which was great because I love them and it wasn't loud enough to wake us up! Yassien was great he gave us the info we needed let us know how to get ahold of him and left us alone. It was nice since we wanted to get last minute tickets to a comedy show. Beautiful apartment and comfortable and large bed!
9058595;60398277;2016-01-23;51981712;Will;Great location! The apartment had everything you'd need. Yassien was attentive and when we found the kettle was broken, he organised a replacement within a few hours.

2735075;101377522;2016-09-13;16390120;Stephanie;"We really enjoyed our stay in Karin's house. The house is very spacious and super comfortable. Karin and her husband were also very helpful. 
We would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Amsterdam but also want to relax in between all the touristy stuff! 
Thank you Karin!"
9165626;66888856;2016-03-25;4396039;Elke;Very nice, quite, clean Place. WE liked it a lot. Interesting neihgburhood.
9165626;68086648;2016-04-02;53962076;Sophie;"This was the perfect location for us - very easy ride into the centre of town, but a quiet and friendly neighbourhood and not at all touristy.

The apartment itself was clean and comfortable and contained all that we needed for cooking and relaxing - my son particularly enjoyed the reclining chair!"
9165626;70081595;2016-04-16;54892749;Alejandro;"La casa esta genial, todas las comodidades que necesites las tienes,  nosotros encontramos un monton de comida la cual él dueño te dice que puedes utilizarla todo lo que quieras, el barrio muy tranquilo a 10 minutos del tren (una sola parada y estas en la estacion central de amsterdam) y a 3 minutos del tranvia (que en 3 paradas estas en pleno centro) en bicicleta unos 10 minutos y andando unos 25 minutos hasta el centro. 
Resumiendo todo genial , una estancia perfecta."
9165626;106453354;2016-10-06;10232078;Seyedmahmoud;The place is quiet, bright and big and using bus, one can easily reach the city center in less than 20 min. The key was delivered punctually, and internet was fast. There was only  two small problems: 1) The home was cleaned after 2 pm when we have already arrived 2) The heating did not work in the first week of october which was slightly cold, but other than that everything was perfect and I recommend this place :)  one more thing the home number could be a little confusing
9165626;121983316;2016-12-20;81267135;Bernd;We really enjoyed our accommodation. It's good located and everything was clean. We especially liked the shower and the coffeemakers.
5471891;82889703;2016-06-30;70719976;竹平;The house is very good, and the location is good as well.
782254;7109042;2013-09-06;327166;Nayan;This place was quite nice, and Daniela is an extremely gracious and warm host - she was able to accommodate me on just a few hours notice! The location is impossible to beat and the apartment is spacious and clean. Definitely stay here!
782254;31290954;2015-05-04;26119407;Tanja;We had a wonderful stay in the apartment, very central, clean, nicely welcomed, friendly contact before the stay, open for all questions and informations around Amsterdam.
782254;71381563;2016-04-25;51521393;Carina;We had a gorgeous stay at Danielas Appartement. Unfortunately we didn't meet her, but the communication before was pleasent and she arranged that the celaning lady gives us the key, which worked perfectly and she even gave us some tips for Restaurants around. The Appartement looks exactly like on the pictures, it was very cosy and clean! The location was ideal, we could easily reach a lot of places by foot. Everything was perfect and I would recommend Danielas Appartement to everybody!
3357259;17126050;2014-08-07;3546225;Kobi;"thank you very much Chris for a very the best hosting ever.
we hope to come again next time."
13160068;76193235;2016-05-25;71750924;Jay;"Naoufel is a great guy- very welcoming.  His home is luxurious and beautifully kept and he provided more than what was listed in posting.  

Especially great place to stay when flying in/out of Schiphol."
13160068;80898481;2016-06-20;74858746;Alice;Naoufel made us feel extremely at home in his apartment. It was a very comfortable stay with all the necessary facilities and also breakfast which we weren't expecting. The tram stop right outside the building was perfect to get into the city. Naoufel kindly collected us from the airport (late at night) which was only a 10-15 minute drive from his apartment. Would highly recommend!
13160068;112426026;2016-11-06;34473098;April;I highly recommend staying here. Naoufel is an incredibly kind and considerate host. He offered to pick us up from the aiport at the small cost of 15 euro, and even offered to send us back to the airport around 6am when it was time for us to leave Amsterdam. Communication was great - he even recommended a few places around Amsterdam to visit. His place was tidy, clean, modern, and the rooms were very cozy and comfortable. Getting to the city centre was super easy as well - the tram stop is right outside his apartment! Located really close to the supermarket as well. A great stay, 10/10.
13160068;114806331;2016-11-20;99402023;Jonathan;I had a great time at Naoufel's place! He offered to pick me up from the airport for only 15 euros which was very helpful. His place was very clean and he made me feel comfortable. I definitely recommend!
13160068;123405044;2016-12-29;106830937;Vanessa;"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt, der Gastgeber war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Kann ich nur empfehlen"
8209825;124662082;2017-01-02;92092014;Irene;"What a treat! Me and 2 mates were there for New Years. Jeffrey was very flexible about check in and out times, he was really nice and super helpful. The apartment was better than expected. Super cute, the bed was too comfortable, could've slept in throughout our whole stay;-) the area is amazing, near to everything, super beautiful ""instagrammable"" spot very near to my favourite coffee place: Winkel 43- they have AMAZING apple tart. Highly recommendable! Definitely coming back!"
6446260;72576799;2016-05-03;63545862;Gilles;This apartment is fabulous from all perspectives. Larger than I had expected, it offered prime comfort and all the required facilities for cooking, laundry, etc. Given that this is where Leyla normally lives, this apartment has a soul, making it very different from impersonal apartments that one usually finds. It is set in a prime location with a superb view on the Prinsengracht and near excellent restaurants and other facilities. Leyla was not in Amsterdam upon our arrival but her mother was very nice in showing us the place despite our late arrival. Leyla had left various recommendations on the table for us as well as maps and other useful stuff. She had also left some basic food and milk for us, which was most welcome after our long trip. But best of all for me, she had left enough Nespresso capsules to last until we had the time to buy our own: that's what I call being a superlative host! I felt 100% at home away from home and cannot recommend Leyla's place more highly for a most memorable stay.
6446260;86090716;2016-07-14;66426472;Debe;Leyla was the perfect host for me for the week I stayed at her apartment. I was greeted with beautiful flowers, delicious snacks in the refrigerator including champagne and fruit juice and a comprehensive list of useful information. The apartment is very comfortable and perfectly situated to walk to all major areas of interest. Thank you Leyla for being so wonderful
8977644;52455739;2015-10-29;1844641;Tess;Our stay was great! The apartment was just as pictured - very nicely decorated, clean, and spacious. Simone was a great host and helpful for exploring the city. The bikes were also a plus as is was only a short ride anywhere we wanted to go.
8977644;55671982;2015-12-04;38996879;James;"I had a great stay in Amsterdam with Simone and the amazing dog, Willem. As soon as I stepped through the door I felt extremely welcome and had a great chat with Simone, who taught me not only all the best places to go in the centre of town but also all the great and convenient locations in the immediate area.

Simone was a great host, a great person to talk to and a great help in planning what I was going to do and how I was going to get around. I absolutely loved Willem! He is such a lovely dog who wouldn't harm a fly. He is well trained and all he wants in the world are hugs and love.

The flat itself is really nice, clean and spacious with a beautiful balcony. The room I was provided with was great - it came with snacks, a kettle and even Netflix on the TV which was perfect. The bed was super comfy and I had plenty of room. 

Although the flat wasn't really a walkable distance to the city centre, this is no problem at all as there are 2 trams and a bus literally a 30 second walk away that will take you straight to the centre in 15 mins. Simone also provides a bike which will get you anywhere in Amsterdam quickly and allow you to experience the city, the true Amsterdam way. What I liked about the location is that it allowed me to see more of the city as I wasn't confined to just the centre.

I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Amsterdam."
14559560;100380641;2016-09-09;72008278;Natalia;It was an amazing week in Amsterdam! Thank you again to let us be a part of real typical Amsterdam life.
16083074;116180979;2016-11-28;19874278;Katie;Great place, very clean and comfortable bed! Also very accommodating!
16083074;121962272;2016-12-20;8712866;Jasper;Satoru's place is in the Jordaan area, close to plenty of shops, restaurants and coffee places!
16083074;129138164;2017-01-29;62085825;Annelies;Zeer rustige en goede ligging. Perfect om Amsterdam te verkennen.
16083074;129912140;2017-02-03;104363819;Rolando;"Staying in Satoru's place was great. He is very friendly, communicative and completely willing to help. He lives very close to the central train station. Very recommended. If I come back again, I'd like to stay there again.

Thanks Satoru!"
12037039;72738282;2016-05-04;64960346;Zoltán;The house is great, we felt home very soon in it. We really enjoyed staying in the house and so did the children. The living room is great for a night conversation, too. The garden in the back was perfect to store the rented bikes. The neighborhood is very quiet and relaxed.
5925158;46480221;2015-09-11;37340562;Chelsea;We didn't get to meet Denise, but she was extremely nice and helpful leading up to our arrival. Gerrit greeted us at the apartment and he was so cool and casual - made us feel welcome right away! The apartment is amazing - excellent location, spacious bedroom, cute little balcony and awesome kitchen. It didn't bother us as all that Denise and Gerrit were upstairs, it actually made us feel a little better knowing they were there in case we needed anything. We LOVED this apartment and would recommend it to anyone!
5925158;51275229;2015-10-19;39754161;Adam;Fantastic hosts and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I was looking for accommodation with two beds which would be suitable for my mother and I whilst I was in Amsterdam running the marathon. The place was tidy, modern and cosy. Would recommend to anybody looking for an alternative to an overpriced hotel room!
5925158;58266858;2016-01-02;25424111;Daniel;Had a lovely stay in this querky flat. Great location in a beautiful part of Amsterdam and a great price considering we stayed over the new year weekend. Hosts were very friendly and would recommend this to anyone.
5925158;61203509;2016-02-01;8881993;Steve;"We enjoyed out stay very much.  The location was fantastic, the flat was clean and cozy, and very important for us - the bed was extremely comfortable.  We expected to be woken by traffic sounds early in the morning but slept until almost noon! (jetlag helped).

We were greeted nicely, let into the flat earlier than expected, and overall the hospitality was perfect.  Helpful and genuine.

The washroom is small ... tall men be warned!  :)

Overall a very positive experience we would recommend to others."
5925158;73583907;2016-05-08;37605808;Jeanne;We had a fantastic weekend in Amsterdam. The apartment was close to the centre and in a lovely part of town surrounded by bars and restaurants. It was a pleasure to stay in and I wouldn't hesitate to return myself of recommend anyone else. Denise was so accommodating and available and even left us a bottle of wine.
5925158;74929424;2016-05-17;4846928;Matthew;We liked this apartment and felt it had all the amenities we needed,  The windows kept the street noise out.  So close to many great places including restaurants and groceries.  The host was available to us  when we needed her.  The bathroom is a bit small but fully functional.  Thx!
5925158;75730676;2016-05-22;50989733;Hazar;Oldukça ilgililer. Giriş yaptığımızda bir şehir haritası üzerinde görmek isteyebileceğimiz yerleri anlattılar. Bir şişe şarap ikram ettiler ve son gün çıkış saatinden sonra da bavulların dairede kalmasını sorun etmediler. Sadece ev fotoğraflardaki kadar büyük değil, özellikle banyo cidden çok dar ve fayanslar soğuk :) Bir de gelirken terlik getirin.
5925158;77775804;2016-06-03;61388446;Blake;Denise was a pleasant host. She accommodated for a late arrival and a late checkout. We arrived around 22:00 and hadn't had dinner. We couldn't read the menus online and she helped us order food. One of us left earrings and she looked through the vacuum cleaner back to find the earring. She was very nice and the place is very close to the Anne Frank house as well as river canal tours. We felt save in the area we stayed (lock to get in building and another locked door upstairs to get through) the place has a really nice bedroom and a pull out couch. The bathroom is tiny and we had trouble with getting the temperature not burning hot or freezing cold. Overall, I would highly recommend Denise and her flat. It was very artsy and quiet. The bedroom has double paned windows that block out all street noise. I would stay there again if I go back to Amsterdam.
5925158;80456528;2016-06-18;5318937;Cem;We stayed in Denise s apartment for one night with a friend and we are really happy to have chosen this place.The apt is really well located in Jordaan,close to all the small cafes and bars, confortable and tidy.Denise has been a great host, helping with every question we had about the neighbourhood.Great experience overall!
5925158;101397580;2016-09-13;14525803;Nicolas;The flat is charming and in a great location. The hosts were also welcoming and well accommodating. Overall great value !
5925158;109690848;2016-10-22;3027938;Ian;"We have a great time staying here. Everything was as expected - we met both Garrit and Denise through our stay and always felt as though we could reach out if we needed anything. The apartment has charm and is as shown in the photos. People have noted on the noise and based on the area you could hear what was going on around you, but for us it wasn't to the point where it was an issue. Top of list was this is a fantastic location close to pretty much everything and if you want to be ""in it"", this is an amazing place to stay. We would definitely come back."
5925158;121210835;2016-12-15;64109686;Joel;Thank you again for letting us stay at your apartment, we had a wonderful stay!
5925158;127976952;2017-01-22;78670155;Ziya;"It's a lovely place and close to all areas of Amsterdam.
I like the home generally and Denise was a very welcoming.
The beds are very comfortable but bathroom is tiny.
I surely recommend this home who'll visit Amsterdam."
5925158;128604130;2017-01-26;15177482;Samantha;"Staying at Denise's apartment was great! She made checking in easy, was there to help us get settled in, and the place was just as described in pictures. Perfect if you want to be right in the heart of Amsterdam! We were walking distance to most major attractions, like the Anne Frank House and the Rijksmuseum.

I highly recommend staying with Denise!"
5925158;137103946;2017-03-13;13004428;Megan;Such a beautiful, comfortable apartment in an amazing Amsterdam neighborhood. Denise was a very helpful, friendly host. I'll be recommending this listing to friends and family in the future!
5925158;137417132;2017-03-15;8990594;Peter;Apartment is very stylish and cozy at the same time with absolutely unique location. We had a lovely days with family in this flat. Thank you, Denise
11404636;91010495;2016-08-03;84067203;Vasileios;"Maaike was there on time and was very friendly and welcoming. Apartment is great and the decoration is incredibly tasteful. 
The bed was probably the most comfortable we've ever slept :) and the apartment had everything we needed and was very clean.

Neighborhood is nice and safe and quite close to city centre (20 mins walk) or 5 mins with 48 bus just around the corner. There is also a convenient super market nearby.

Check out was done via neighbor whom also was very friendly and on time.

Overall a great experience that really felt like home.

PS: If your first time in Ams watch out the bicycles and motorcycles. They drive like kamikazes."
11404636;108750576;2016-10-17;94652930;Kristian;Maaike's apartment is a perfect place to stay whilst in Amsterdam. The area is clean, quiet and close to the city. Maaike was their to greet us despite us arriving earlier than scheduled. Her apartment is really nice, very cosy, and she even bought us breakfast to have in the morning! She gave us everything we need in terms of trams, Wi-Fi password etc. Would highly recommend!
11404636;112506685;2016-11-06;18968895;Elisa;Heel fijne plek op een heel fijne locatie. Buiten het drukke centrum, maar nog steeds vlot bereikbaar. Aanrader!
11404636;125330567;2017-01-05;78748736;Anton;Удобно расположенная просторная квартира с 3 спальнями, кухней-гостиной и внутренним двориком. До площади дам пешком 20-30 минут. Для удобного проживаете есть все необходимое. Расположена в тихом месте. До ближайшего магазина 7 минут пешком. Кому лень готовить- рядом есть кафе.
16624284;129757795;2017-02-02;92958751;Dave;Honestly, this was one of the best stay with airbnb we have had yet! Me and my boyfriend Dave (account holder) frequent airbnb and no host has been as understanding, accommodating, and genuinely nice like Marco and Ralph!! House had everything we needed and they even put a few drinks in the fridge for us! Check in and out times were more than flexible and they even have an inside place for luggage if you can't get inside right away so you can just drop at the door. Location was the BEST right near everything in the city. They provide an address easily accessible with gps and brings you right to the front door. Keyless lock code is up to date and much more preferable than remembering to bring keys with you everywhere. Overall 5 stars for us and we will definitely be staying there again next time we visit
7302839;49244489;2015-10-02;31557757;Barbara;Denise offers a lovely apartment about a 7 min bike ride to the main train station/city center. Impeccably clean and modern, we enjoyed the snacks she left for us on her porch and her wifi was fast and reliable. Denise was passionate about different places to see and eat in Amsterdam. She was always just a text away and left a binder with all pertinent information needed for our stay. She suggested visiting the Rijksmuseum, and it was wonderful as we enjoyed our jaunts around the canals and various bars, restaurants, and seeing different sights. From our easy transition upon the arrival at Denise's home until the minute we left, Denise made our stay easy, relaxed, and fun! Denise is an excellent host and I would recommend her place to anyone heading to Amsterdam!
9528440;67843274;2016-03-31;39646233;Brian;Welcoming host, accurate location and accommodation description and pretty convenient to tram system.
9528440;72208660;2016-05-01;31032108;Lisa;"The apartment was lovely,very comfortable and in a great location.
The bikes were a great addition and made our trip,also loved the cats very cute
We would definetly recommend it"
9528440;111655210;2016-11-01;88502805;Heike;"Die Wohnung war genauso wie beschrieben, schönes Ambiente und Ausstattung, strategisch gut gelegen. Zu Fuß oder mit den zur Verfügung gestellten Fahrräder erreicht man alle Sehenswürdigkeit sehr schnell. 
Die Katzen zu versorgen, war völlig unproblematisch und sie waren auch ganz lieb! 
Ich würde diese Wohnung immer wieder anmieten und kann sie nur empfehlen!"
4876528;30092396;2015-04-17;29129926;Ryan;"Vanda and Robert made me and my girlfriend feel very welcome. They were wonderful hosts and went out of their way to help us out.

The apartment has a great view and is in a very good central location while still being very quiet at night.

The shower was wonderful and the bath was extra long, great for 2.

We're very happy with this apartment and would be happy to stay again. Amsterdam was great!"
4876528;33255738;2015-05-26;25824247;Paul;"Vanda was lovely. She meet us at the airport as we were tight on time and explained to use how to find the apartment and handed over the keys to us.
The apartment was a 20min walk from Amsterdam central station in a very lovely neighborhood over looking a canal as pictured. The photos posted are very accurate and the apartment is full of natural light and spacious. It is on the 3rd level of the building so expect a walk up the stairs but there is a service elevator available to use. Please communicate this to Vanda if the elevator is required for access as its intended for service use only.
Highly recommended staying at Vanda's apartment and she is only a message away if you need anything or want to know anything."
4876528;110060706;2016-10-24;29219771;Tayfun;Vanda's place is really great. We arrived at night and her helper was waiting for us already. House is really clean and comfortable. You can find literally everything in the house, everything is there for your comfort. The view is amazing, fell in love with that. Really peaceful and fun! Definitely recommended and will be chosen next time again!
9343043;56743100;2015-12-17;6500959;Guillermo;Sabine was the perfect host. She really helped us on the arrival and the departure and the house was in a perfect state. I would totally recommend her.
4961851;34302825;2015-06-07;17146711;Carolin;Die Wohnung von Benjamin war so wie auf den Bildenr zu sehen und wie sie hier auch von ihm beschrieben wurde. Für 4 Personen hatten wir ausreichend Platz (2 schliefen im großen Bett im Schlafzimmer und zwei auf ausklappbaren Matratzen im Wohnzimmer). Es waren für alle Bettwäsche und ausreichend Handtücher vorhanden. Ein Freund von Benjamin hat uns in die Wohnung gelassen und war sehr nett. Dort lagen auch Prospekte mit Veranstaltungen, Busplänen etc. aus, was für uns sehr hilfreich war! Die Wohnung lag in einem insgesamt recht ruhigen Viertel, hier war nichts los, auch keine Kneipen o.Ä. in der Umgebung. Wir konnten jedoch fußläufig in 5 Minuten ein Einkaufscenter erreichen, wo man Lebensmittel besorgen konnte. Mit dem Bus (Bushaltestelle direkr um die Ecke) waren wir in 10-15 Minuten mitten im zentralen, schönen  Amsterdam.
4961851;71304623;2016-04-24;55744761;Arundathi;"I would recommend this house !! Benjamin was a very kind host. He came to the bus stop to pick us up and helped us with the luggage (since the house is in 2nd floor without elevator. there is a small and safe place to store the kinderwagon anyway). The house is very clean and neat with fully equipped kitchen (rice cooker being of great use), a wonderful cozy sofa and a nice bedroom. There is Iidl supermarket at walking distance. The house is well connected to Amsterdam Central station (bus no.34) which runs frequently. Benjamin was very kind in accommodating our luggage well past the check-out time as we had huge luggage and couldn't store them in the lockers at the central station.
I would give the place a 4 on 5."
4961851;77005963;2016-05-30;53748496;Mollee;The apartment was very nice and in a good location, not far from the city centre.
4961851;94437798;2016-08-15;62138313;Quentin;"Benjamin n'était pas présent pour notre arrivé mais c'est un ami à lui, Nicolas qui nous a accueilli. Il nous a très bien informé sur l'appartement, et les modes de transport qu'on pouvait utiliser pour se rendre en centre ville. L'appartement est très bien situé, prenez le bus 34 (l'arrêt est à 50m) et passe tous les 10min il vous amènera jusqu'au ferry qui lui vous emmènera à central station
L'appartement était très propre et conforme à la description. En plus vous avez très facilement une place de parking.. N'hésitez pas ! (Malgré son absence Benjamin a tout de même prix le temps de savoir si on avez été bien installé etc..)"
4961851;99546719;2016-09-05;53624921;Gabrielle;Benjamin's friend greeted us at the flat and was very friendly and provided us with useful information. The flat is spacious, modern and comfortable and the photos and information are accurate. It is not located in the city centre but it is an easy bus trip into the centre.
2891805;52974369;2015-11-03;3460978;Slav;We've had a great experience at Esther's place, it is exactly as described, clean, modern and has everything a couple needs. It is located in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. It's on the first floor so no stair climbing is necessary. We loved everything about it, especially the small garden and we would definitely recommend it.
13144755;128253390;2017-01-23;76056099;Rachel;Our second time staying at Kathleen's place. A lovely apartment, in a perfect location. Communication with Kathleen was quick and easy. A great place to stay in Amsterdam!
2763589;28814065;2015-03-30;28765990;Kyle;Great Host. Erwin in really kind and willing to help you get settled. The apartment is quite nice, and gives you plenty of private space. The neighborhood is pleasant, and within reasonable walking distance to the city and the university.
2763589;29292372;2015-04-06;4728381;Gustavo;Erwin was a great host. He was there on time and he greeted me with a map and a cup of coffee. He even let me borrow his bike. His apartment is in a great location, very close to the city centre. I would definitely recommend his place for anyone.
2763589;29448004;2015-04-07;29561915;Bobby;Great host & great location. The bedroom is perfect for a solo traveler and the house is located in very quite neighborhood. Top of that, Erwin was kind enough to let me borrow his bike and museum pass.

2763589;86345214;2016-07-16;52086703;Hui Mei;Erwin's house is great! Her daughter, Ymke, however is the one accommodating us. She is very helpful and kind and informative! She helped with the direction of her house, giving me info for buying SIM card and etc. I arrived late and checked in late, she was totally chilled with that as well and waited for me. Also, I faced some problems during my days in Ams but she was being very kind to help me. Overall, her house is clean and I have a big private room there. Very satisfying!
2763589;96586624;2016-08-23;4728381;Gustavo;Third time staying at Erwin's place. Great host and great location. Highly recommend !

Thank you Erwin!"

4296384;43745651;2015-08-22;4245926;Aldo;Paul is an excellent host, kind and helpful. He also gives us museum and public transport cards. The apartment is near the city centre in a quiet neighborhood where you can find restaurants and pubs and close to the metro station. The room is equipped with everything you need for a pleasant accomodation. You can prepare breakfast in the kitchen with all the necessary equipment and stuff. Variety of tea and corn flakes, jams, milk, coffee, bread and so on.
4296384;56846356;2015-12-19;45969216;Cheang;Paul's apartment was cozy and clean!  He had everything ready for us and the check in and check out procedures went along with no hitch!

Das Appartement ist sehr gemütlich, sauber und liegt nahe beim trendigen Viertel ""Jordaan"". Paulie war sehr unkompliziert und hat die Schlüsselübergabe bestens organisiert, obwohl sie weg war das Weekend. Super Erfahrung und wir würden dieses Appartement jedem weiterempfehlen!!"

6210110;34547510;2015-06-09;32606984;Rachel;'Twas neat. The apartment was in a great location, very close to a team station to get downtown and a bus station to get to the airport. The apartment was perfect size for 3 people and in a safe quiet neighborhood. Vera and her daughters are fantastic!
6210110;53539613;2015-11-09;39699698;Nancy;Vera personally met us to go over the details of the unit and give us keys. She also had a nice breakfast for our first day ready in the fridge. We had a nice talk and she made us feel right at home. The unit is in a very nice neighborhood about 20 minutes from the center of Amstrrdam. the team is one block away as well as an entire outdoor plaza with everything you need. The unit is just as described with very nice appliances and bedding. My son, his girlfriend and I were very comfortable.
13324244;116960305;2016-12-04;104268085;Rebecca;"From beginning to end Maarten was a great host and we always felt that if there were any problems (which there weren't) you would be able to help us. 
We were able to check-in late due to a late flight and this was no problem. We felt very safe in the apartment and the location was excellent, approx 10min walk to Anne Frank's House. 
Becuase of the late arrival we spent the first night in a local bar just a 2min walk away from the apartment, drinking with the locals. 
There is a large supermarket opposite the road we stayed in, which was very convenient. 
The apartment was clean, beautifully decorated and we loved the luxurious little extras that there were. 
The bed was comfortable and Maarten gave us lots of tips and information in the welcome handbook.
We have already passed your details onto two friends, as they were so impressed with our pictures and review. 
Many thanks again, 
Becky and Lewis"
13482208;95889152;2016-08-21;45803994;Cloe;I will really recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam that beautiful apartment. The location is great, you have all the facilities and is well decorate. Helena left us a bottle of wine and some cheese so you couldn't ask for better welcoming. I definitely go back there if I'm going back to Amsterdam. Highly recommended and the neighborhood is lovely and quiet! :)
6667963;58834982;2016-01-05;18932103;Stephanie;What a beautiful loft! Jaap's place was the perfect home base for our stay in Amsterdam. He made us feel at home from the time we walked in the door, and was very accommodating in regards to our arrival and departure time. If you're into minimalism/modern spaces, this is an inspiring spot to begin and end the day in Amsterdam. Very convenient to take the tram into city center and tons of great food and coffee options very close by in a relatively quiet neighborhood. Would absolutely stay again!
621108;20450402;2014-09-29;2247373;Didi;"Assaf's house made our vacation perfect.
Best location & cozy, we really felt there at home :)
Will definitely schedule our next trip to Amsterdam according to him!"
621108;48558023;2015-09-27;27824480;Renato;"Assaf's place is great. The lighting and temperature was perfect for me.  It's clean and it has everything you need. There are a lot of cafe's, restos, and a supermarket nearby so you have a lot of food options. 

I spent a lot of time just walking around and taking photos nearby since Jordaan is so beautiful--Lots of canals and small shops with interesting things. 

If I came back to Amsterdam, I would like to stay in Assaf's place again."

10833989;72806924;2016-05-04;16381948;Donavon;"Loved the apartment! It's in a quiet neighbourhood but is close to shops, sights and transit.

The beds were super comfy and the space is bright and clean. 

We were four people sharing the apartment and it never felt crowded. 

Stephen was also very accommodating with respect to checking in/out.

Can't say enough good things about this listing!"
10833989;92513486;2016-08-08;74354126;Tracey;"I liked the apartment and location alot.The welcome was minimal  and and communication was  somewhat lacking . The host was on his  way out of town and should have left a local persons contact info.

The apartment had a great layout  and location and furnished decently. 
But  for the price- some conveniences were a little lacking."
10833989;128762901;2017-01-27;65188589;Nima;We were a group of 6 friends and we all loved the place. It was in a great location, clean, and the communication with the host was great. Will definately visit again.

Lei è molto disponibile sia per l'orario di check-in sia per quello di check-out,oltre che ad essere molto gentile! La casa era molto pulita e il centro era facilmente raggiungibile a piedi,una zona molto sicura e tranquilla!
15351777;138157429;2017-03-19;61693839;Vadim;Maria was very accommodating and her place is in a great location that feels like a local neighborhood but is also close to the more touristy attractions. I'd recommend staying here if in Amsterdam!
12262154;73541220;2016-05-08;11546493;Gwenaëlle;"Superbe séjour chez Lotte. L'appartement n'est pas au centre même mais il reste tout de même très bien localisé et on est très vite au centre. Le confort y est et l'appartement est spacieux et lumineux. La vue sur le canal du balconnet et la petite terrasse sont très agréable. A proximité on trouve de tout : location de vélo, bar ...
Son frère nous a très bien accueilli et nous a donné des conseils pour notre séjour. De plus, nous avons pu nous arrangé facilement pour l'arrivé et le départ.
NB : nous n'avons pas trouvé de port USB pour le disque dur sur la télé."
12262154;75706206;2016-05-22;27399101;Suzanna;"Lotte is absolutely fabulous! Her directions from the airport were clear so my journey from the airport to the apartment was very quick and easy. It's also a very short journey from the airport, so convenient for people not wanting to travel for very long. Lotte very kindly met me at the tram stop as well, which was awesome!

The apartment in the photos is lovely, but it's even better in person - it was very clean and so tidy. Plenty of space for me to hang out and do my own thing and the local area is very cool - good bars and lovely restaurants, but also a few supermarkets if you want to buy your own groceries.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again - Lotte is amazing and her apartment is wonderful."
15427964;125900781;2017-01-08;76081988;Marcel;"Sophie welcomed us personally at her place, which was comfortable and tidy. The Tram lines 12, 13 and 14 stop nearby and take you to most places in the city.
We enjoyed our stay here!"
15427964;131373770;2017-02-12;19104365;Sebastian;Sophie was a nice and friendly host. The place is truely cosy, perfectly located close to the city center and had its share of our great weekend.
15427964;132749778;2017-02-19;54596992;Pascale;L'appartement de Sophie est très agréable, situé près des canaux il propose une très belle vue. A proximité de commerces et des trams, il est très facile de se rendre en ville et même à pied (20-15 min).
1267645;5333753;2013-06-24;6993788;Beth;"Our trip to Amsterdam was a great joy due to our stay on the house boat.  Tjalling had a nice set up with a fridge for our use, two comfy beds, stand-alone shower, even a small barbeque grill!  The boat is a few minutes’ walk from the grocery store and the tram.  It was quite rainy our first day there, so we barbequed on the deck and had a nice lazy afternoon.  Much better than being cramped up in a hotel room.  Definitely recommend it; if I go back, I will stay on this boat again!"
1267645;7212019;2013-09-10;3118677;Ilia;Me and my girlfriend were staying at Tjalling`s houseboat for several days and it turned out very impressive and wonderful vacation. This boat gives you very authentic and pure feeling of Amsterdam. It has two cozy bedrooms and very spacious living zone and fully equipped kitchen. Everything was just perfect! Thank you Tjalling for these memorable moments.
1267645;113554024;2016-11-13;99849326;Dave;"Myself and my girlfriend stayed on this very spacious houseboat for 2 nights.
it was surprisingly spacious and mailntained a to a high standard.
The bathrooms were very impressive with really good shower : great pressure and hot water ( especially the small one )
We were only 2 but you could have 4 very comfortably.
Its in  pleasant area with a couple of nice cafes for lunch close by.
its about a 20 minute walk to the centre of amsterdam so the party is close by but its great to have somewhere to get away from ""the party"" 
We reallly liked that we woke up in a chilled nice area as opposed to stepping out your door to the beautiful but extremely busy amsterdam city centre.
So when you have some breakfast / lunch you can start to head into town and enjoy amsterdam at its finest !
The host was very flexible with our check in and particularly our check out times which really made our weekend even better.( thank you for that by the way )
highly recommended ..... we will be back !"
95540;4105561;2013-04-10;4740825;Karen;We had a great time staying at Jasper's. He was very friendly and helpful, went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our time in Amsterdam. My husband and I totally recommend staying at the Vondel studio, a fab location and lots of fun to be had getting lost around Amsterdam on those bikes!
95540;8564364;2013-11-05;8781288;Cesare;"Ci vorrebbe un Voldenpark Studio in ogni città del mondo! l'appartamento è perfetto per passarci le vacanze in due! dentro casa non manca niente ed inoltre ci sono svariate info per come e dove visitare la città messe li da jasper! jasper all'arrivo spiega tutto quel che c'è da sapere con molta semplicità fornendoti di tutte le card e le chiavi. avrete 2 bicilette (indispensabili per amsterdam!) e card di bus e tram. sinceramente prima di partire pensavo che fosse lontano dal centro invece si è vicinissimi. insomma noi se torniamo ad amsterdam andremo di sicuro di nuovo da Jasper! 
Cesare e Giada!"
95540;11164232;2014-03-23;7786967;Blake;Jasper was an excellent host. The apartment was fantastic. Jasper left very detailed instruction about everything making our vacation super easy. The bikes were fantastic and it was a joy to get to ride around in such a bike friendly city. The apartment is fully equipped with all the necessities you will need and then some. When we go to Amsterdam again we will definitely stay here.
95540;11398612;2014-04-01;11940414;Stefan;Jasper was an excellent host. He gave a lot of useful information when we arrived and in the booklet about the apartment. We loved to ride through Amsterdam with the bikes and we enjoyed the quietness of the surrounding of the apartment (which is a big contrast compared to the busy downtown of Amsterdam) and the Vondelpark. The Vondelpark Studio is ideally situated: quiet but not to far from the center. We can recommend it to anybody.
95540;12740140;2014-05-10;8505515;Duy;We had an awesome time in Amsterdam. The studio was great, located a few steps from Vondelpark and tram stop. Everything looked like it did in the pictures and all the extra amenities such as the bikes and tram cards were added bonus. I would not hesitate to recommend this apartment.
95540;14021080;2014-06-10;12109018;Joke;"Jasper is een zeer goede gastheer en laat zijn gasten meteen welkom voelen in het mooie Amsterdam. 
We kregen een korte rondleiding in het appartement, dat zeer proper en orderlijk was, een ideaal verblijf dichtbij het centrum.
De Frederiksstraat is een zijstraat van het Vondelpark. Een park, zeer levendig, maar ook zeer ontspannend en rustgevend binnen de bruisende stad. 
s'Avonds konden we in het park genieten van een aantal optredentjes. 
Een grote meerwaarde was het gebruik van de fietsen, die ons op korte tijd overal naartoe brachten en ons lieten genieten van de verschillende uitzichten in Amsterdam. Het is alvast een aanrader om voor dit verblijf te kiezen!"
95540;20740791;2014-10-05;7338742;Lars;"Jasper is a great host. Very kindly and helpful to all your questions. The apartment is clean and nice and has a wonderful atmosphere with the great record player and a lot of records. You can use all the things that you find inside.

We took the two bikes to visit hole Amsterdam. You have to try it out! A bit chaos in some situations on street but you will adapt it. I can recommend it. :)

Jasper gives you many tips to see nice places and visit delicious restaurants. 

All in all we had a wonderful time in Amsterdam! :))

Greetings from Germany"
95540;22585434;2014-11-10;1447258;Marina;Great apartment well located, jasper is very kind and helpfull. And to decover this beautiful city with the bicycles is so nice. Don't hesitate!

La mise à disposition des vélos et des cartes de transport ( + musées) sont un véritable confort.
C'est un adresse que je recommande vivement à tous ceux qui veulent passer un super séjour à Amsterdam!!!"
95540;31760644;2015-05-10;24714732;Matthew;Great apartment and great host. Jasper is very friendly and only happy to help.
95540;35975031;2015-06-23;9572105;Annabelle & Julien;We had a great time staying at the Vondelpark studio for 2 nights. We were very nicely received by Jasper who is very helpful (thank you!) and the 2nd-floor appartment is clean and nicely furnished with everything one needs to feel at home quickly (even first necessity products are provided).  We had space for the babybed as well. The area is great, restaurants and supermarkets are just around the corner as is the beautiful Vondelpark. The 2 bikes that were at our disposal (great to have them included in the rental!!) allowed us to be in the city centre in 10 minutes and to explore beautiful Amsterdam just like locals. We really enjoyed our stay and would go back anytime!
95540;56307768;2015-12-12;41899633;Karo;"Jaspers' hospitality was like out of a storybook;-) super helpful (with all explanations, bonus-chips for grocery, free museum-cards, etc.), kind and uncomplicated. the apartment was like the description, nice neighborhood, funny bikes and a pleasant experience!"

Very helpful & everything were perfectly like what he describe in the listing; location easily accessible to all places of interest either by walking or taking the tram which is very near the apartment. Apartment was cosy & clean and it has everything that you need. This is our first time with Airbnb and it turn out to be wonderful. We will definitely come back again to Amsterdam  & will without a doubt pick Jasper's apartment again! :D"
95540;65259725;2016-03-12;19526401;Jessica;Staying at Jaspers was lovely. Once over the initial steep Dutch stair case, (which is fun after a while). The apartment is clean, light & has everything you need! Jasper was exceptionally helpful he gave us a manual for the apartment & also emailed me a guide of the city of places to eat etc, before hand. The bikes were a great perk, we rode through Vondel park which is beautiful! The apartment is super close to the centre & we were very grateful for having the met cards. Thank you for having me and my boyfriend Jasper.
95540;74286031;2016-05-14;46833012;Nikita;"Jasper is an awesome host: friendly, attentive, accommodating and well prepared! 

He responded quickly to the initial booking and kept us updated as we were counting days to our trip. About a week before the check-in date we received final instructions with addresses and directions on how to get to the apartment from all the major transportation points. 

Along with directions, Jasper shared a custom map, where he carefully pointed out all useful and fun spots around the apartment: the store that sells stamps, nearest hospital or a police station, major attractions, restaurant recommendations and much more! I wish we had more than a week in Amsterdam, so we could try all the suggestions Jasper had for us, but anything that we did get to try - was superb! This list alone is worth the 5 star rating! 

Apartment, was exactly as described. While it’s not in the immediate downtown area it is just a short walk (or even shorter bike or tram ride) away from the heart of it all. This is a perfect neighborhood to be in! Trendy, safe and quiet, right next to the park, it gives you a chance to take a deep breath and rejuvenate after a full day of exploring everything that Amsterdam has to offer. Apartment was cozy, clean, had a very homey feel and had everything that you might need for a comfortable stay. Jasper also provided us with the museum and transport cards which saved us a lot of money! And of course the complimentary bikes were a huge help.

I hope that the studio is still available when we visit the Amsterdam next time. I’ll definitely stay there again!"
95540;74971020;2016-05-17;2555367;Terry;Thank you Jasper for an AMAZING EXPERIENCE!  It was exactly what we were looking for in a location in a nice quiet area of town near Vondell Park yet easy to get to Central too.  What we loved most was really getting what Airbnb is all about, the opportunity to live like a local.  Your recommendations for quiet, quaint, local restaurants with amazing food were the BEST!!!!  You also gave us some tips on how to enjoy Amsterdam that are not in any travel blog,especially the panoramic view of the city!  Having access to the two bikes to use whenever we wanted was also priceless to enjoy the park, going down to Central and riding the canals.  The perfect way to truly enjoy Amsterdam!  Thank again!
95540;93802263;2016-08-14;78310312;Iain;Perfect location, a stone throw from Vondelpark, nice flat with a fridge, cooking facilities and shower, comfortable bed and a PC for browsing the internet and playing music. Jasper was a great host. He gave us travel cards which were really useful for the metro, and lent us two bikes on top of providing some really useful tips and pointers. So much better than staying in a hotel!!
95540;105423596;2016-10-01;2338568;Felipe;Great location. Steps from the Vondel Park and the Overtoom which makes it easy to get around on bikes. Even though Jasper was out of town, check in was simple with his kind neighbor, and the house instruction book was very clear and well done. The apartment was comfortable for our short stay, but we wished the towels and linens could have been in better shape.
95540;106792796;2016-10-08;74097635;Marina;"Der beste Aufenthalt, den man in Amsterdam haben kann!!!
Das Studio ist sehr geräumig, super sauber, und bestens ausgestattet. Die Küche hat alles was man braucht um zu kochen. Alle Geräte funktionieren einwandfrei. Bettwäsche, handtücher, Fön, Duschgel selbst Einwegrasierer ;).
Die Umgebung ist toll. Überall sind Restaurants und Cafés und kleine Shops,auch 2 ganz besondere ;) Einer davon direkt nebenan. 
Jasper ist sehr nett und gibt sich viel Mühe Insidertipps für wirklich aussergewöhnliche Locations, die in keinem Reiseführer stehen zu vermitteln. 
Das Appartement hat eine perfekt Lage, direkt am Vondelpark (der schönste in Amsterdam). Es gibt eine Haltestelle 3 Gehminuten entfernt. Jasper stellt 2 Fahrräder kostenlos zur Verfügung, öffentliche Verkehrskarten mit denen man Bahnen und Busse benutzen kann und auch Museumskarten die kostenlosen oder billigeren Eintritt gewähren.

Alles in allem war es perfekt. Sucht nicht weiter, bucht bei Jasper. Ihr werdet es kaum besser treffen!"

Très bel appartement (couleurs vives) bien équipé (il manque juste un micro-ondes et un lavabo dans la sdb). Escaliers raides. Jasper est un excellent hôte : il est présent dès l'entrée dans les lieux, il explique le fonctionnement de l'appartement (il nous parlait anglais et répétait sans problème lorsque nous ne comprenions pas tout), il laisse des cartes de tram à disposition ainsi qu'une carte de réduction pour le supermarché principal de la ville. Il répond rapidement aux mails et conseille des restaurants à tester. Excellent rapport qualité/prix, à recommander.

8156455;75584043;2016-05-22;13155279;Patrick;The apartment was just as it looked in the pictures. Great location, easy to find, and walk to from the train station. Very clean, quiet. Very comfortable bed. Well equipped kitchen. Great TV reception and picture. Lots to discover in the area.  We enjoyed our stay here and would love to return.
8156455;76446873;2016-05-27;17944300;Brad;We had a fantastic time staying at Marjin's apartment! The Jordaan was a quiet, nice, genuine neighbourhood with nice shops and fantastic restaurants. It served as a great home base for our first time in Amsterdam. The apartment is spacious with a nice kitchen, and really comfy couch!
8156455;102712393;2016-09-18;1284994;Ash;We had an absolutely wonderful stay. Beautiful apartment in a perfect location, quiet and easy to walk around
8156455;104698636;2016-09-28;82689474;Gregory;Very friendly host. Great neighborhood.
3799447;19549877;2014-09-14;18948925;Ashley;This was our second time visiting Amsterdam and I wouldn't visit it any other way than using Airbnb. Fleur's place was perfect for us. The place was spotless when we arrived and it looked just like the pictures. We can't say anything more positive about the place than it matches her description perfectly. She even had a bottle of wine waiting for us. Fleur was everything you want in a host and  provided us with all the information we needed to make our stay in Amsterdam the best vacation we've had. If you have a chance to stay at Fleur's please do so, you will not be disappointed.
2762232;14052087;2014-06-10;15666125;Gesa;Robin was an easy and uncomplicated host. He even brought us fruits and coffee for the arrival. The bath though is tiny but for a weekend trip alright. We slept very well and really enjoyed the breakfast on the sunny and bright balcony. All in all we can only recommend the host and the flat. Also the flat is located in a nice area near to the Vodelpark and the next tram station plus an 20-30 min walk from the city center.
2762232;14647394;2014-06-23;15758235;Patrick;Robin was a great host, easy to deal with and allowed me check in/out later than usual. Apartment had everything you require, the dining room which opens to the balcony is fantastic for those warms mornings. Location is perfect for this who want to experience the local life away for the big smoke of city but only 10mins tram ride to it. Supermarkets, bars, transports are all on the Main Street and Vondelpark is only short walking distance away.
2762232;15717437;2014-07-14;17501573;Magali;We spent a great week end in Amsterdam, Robin was very nice and his apartment extremely well located. It's spacious and has a lot of natural light. We especially enjoyed the balcony, such a nice touch. There are a lot of really good cafes around, as well as a supermarket across the street if you'd rather cook for yourself. The Vondelpark is right there, and the apartment is walking distance to all of the major museums and some nice bars as well. Would definitely stay at Robin's again!
2762232;18854802;2014-09-01;10700083;Maxime;Perfect apartment in a nice neighborhood!
2762232;65161126;2016-03-11;57621358;Tatienne;Robin's apartment was exactly as described in the listing.  It was a lovely apartment, with a spacious living/dining room area.  My favorite part about the place was probably the terrace, which was beautiful, and really nice to sit out on and have breakfast.  I would recommend Robin's house as a place to stay! :)
3290024;17461373;2014-08-12;17408813;Louise;"Jorit's apartment was a great place to stay for exploring Amsterdam. It's within easy walking distance of Centraal Station and in a good location with lots of bars and cafes nearby. It was also close enough to walk to the fleamarket at Waterlooplein, which was good to visit.

The apartment is well furnished and comfortable and has a great little balcony to sit and relax and enjoy the fresh air. 

Jorit was helpful in the run up to our trip and left a good set of helpful hints in the apartment about nearby places to eat, drink and other tourist attractions.

I would recommend this as a good place to stay in Amsterdam and I'd definitely consider staying there again when I go back."
3290024;27914556;2015-03-15;17302274;Jay;"The apartment is just as described and how it looks in the pictures; clean, cozy, well equipped, and in a terrific location.  It is very close to the heart of the downtown, but on a very quiet side-street.  Jorit was very helpful in setting up the reservation, and I would definitely stay there again."
253147;4366152;2013-04-30;1120637;Sheila And Ben;We loved the location of this bright space in Amsterdam.  The hosts were really helpful and friendly.  Would highly recommend it.
253147;7007353;2013-09-03;6532000;Leslie;Jonathan was a great host.  He met me at the door and helped with dinner reservations. He texted me to make sure everything was OK. The apartment location can't be beaten.  Right next to the farmers market and numerous interesting pubs. Easy 10 minute walk from the central station. The bed is really comfortable.  The only minor drawback is that the shower and toilet are quite small and on the ground floor.  The only sink is in the kitchen. I would recommend this apartment wholeheartedly.
253147;7514027;2013-09-23;8094159;Sean;"Our vacation was split between Paris and Amsterdam. We stayed at Jonathan's canal house for two days before taking the train back to Paris to catch the plane home (Los Angeles). The house is located in a very nice neighborhood that's an easy 10 minute walk from the train station. Although we were unable to meet Jonathan upon our arrival, he made it easy for us to get the key. When we walked in, a printout sat on the table near the kitchen with local eats, museums, etc. The house is just as described... clean, airy, and well appointed.  Make your way upstairs and you'll find a nice size bedroom with an incredible view of the canal below. The windows are large, and you'll probably find yourself just gazing out of them at times. The bedroom is fully furnished and the bed is very comfy.

Now as other reviews have mentioned, the kitchen, shower, and toilet, are on the main floor. The kitchen sink is the only sink, so you will be brushing your teeth there. The shower is a somewhat like a closet, and the toilet area is indeed very small. But who really wants to spend all day in there anyway? I mention all of this really to suggest that you might find yourself up and down the staircase between the bedroom and main floor when getting dressed or should you have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. This, however, was not an issue for us.

In the end, we had a very good experience. Jonathan texted during our brief stay to check up on us and we encountered no problems. This house is definitely a gem, in a fantastic location. We'd gladly stay again.

253147;24528451;2014-12-30;8409837;Alexandra;Die Lage der Wohnung ist einmalig, wir waren schon oft in Amsterdam und genossen es, so nah am Noordermarkt zu wohnen. Die Wohnung ist großzügig und sehr schön eingerichtet. Man sollte aber wissen, dass man ein Frankfurter Bad und demnach das Waschbecken auch gleichzeitig das Küchenbecken ist. Alles in allem eine tolle Wohnung zum entdecken von Amsterdam.
253147;32481825;2015-05-18;19651203;Jasmina;I stayed for 2 nights with a friend, and Jonathan was incredibly easy going and welcoming. Perfect location and lovely canal house apartment. I honestly hope I'll be able to stay again when I'm next in Amsterdam and would absolutely recommend it.
253147;53123106;2015-11-05;25180567;Mariya;"Everything was perfect! The apartment is sunny( yeah it was 15 degrees), especially the bedroom and cute! The view is amazing from every window. We end up every night drinking wine in the bed and staring at the canal. 
The kitchen is equipped with all necessary thing you could need. 
Every Saturday there is a food market just at the back side of the house with fresh food, bread....
I'll highly recommend the house! We spend a great time!
Thank you Jonathan and Sabine!:)"
253147;56083547;2015-12-08;31273722;Renske;The apartment looks exactly the same as on the picture. Jonathan is a very welcoming host and responds fast to any questions to make you feel at home in his place and the wonderful city of Amsterdam. A place to come to.
253147;78816728;2016-06-09;19461187;Warren;The apartment was great and is in a fantastic location. We really enjoyed our time there. Jonathan was always available and I would recommend this apartment to other travelers!
253147;84875924;2016-07-09;15270062;Jessica;We had a fantastic time staying at Jonathan's apartment. It's just as described and the location is absolutely perfect. Our one regret is that we left early Saturday morning and missed the market that is right outside the front door! Jonathan was very responsive and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. Also, we tried many of his restaurant recommendations and they were all delicious. We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Amsterdam!
253147;107389076;2016-10-10;5196790;Jackie;Jonathan met us at the apartment and showed us round and pointed out how everything operated. He very kindly left us a bottle of wine too. The location of the apartment is superb and probably one of the best in Amsterdam. Overlooking Noordermarkt and the famous Winkel apple pie cafe.  The apartment was spotlessly clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in with beautiful linen and comfortable pillows.  The kitchen area had everything you would need to cook your food there.  And the dining is placed in such a way you can sit and people watch whilst eating. I would recommend this apartment to any of my friends and family. We will be back to continue our exploration of Amsterdam.
253147;109547328;2016-10-22;1519970;Stephanie;Jonathan was an amazing host. He was flexible, responsive, and communicative the whole way through. His place was AMAZING. Right in walking distance to all of the fun while still being quiet, quaint and local. The view from the apartment was perfect. Right on a canal as pictured. We loved having wine and cheese and people watching from the living room. Would definitely recommend staying here.
253147;116983214;2016-12-04;9212247;Jerome;"Jonathan est un hôte accueillant, le logement est parfaitement situé à quelques pas du centre. Un formidable marché Bio à lieu le samedi matin au pied de l'appartement. Le chauffage par le sol est très agréable.
Très bon séjour."

Stayed with friends and the apartment is more than suitable for 2  couples sharing. Would definitely stay here again when we return to Amsterdam! Thanks Sterre and Gwen

3044166;124910102;2017-01-03;9731337;Pascal;It's been a real pleasure to stay in the stylished Hannah and Seb's apartment. We had a great time there and enjoyed very much the space on one floor (110m2) quite unusual in Amsterdam! We will certainly come back.
9556190;92859833;2016-08-10;44259595;Arthur;L'appartement est très bien, propre et lumineux. Je n'ai pas trouvé Erwin si accueillant mais il nous a donné toutes les informations nécessaires pour un séjour à Amsterdam. L'appartement est proche du centre ville grâce au tramway mais les transports étant très chers, c'est un budget à prendre en compte.
9556190;103515424;2016-09-23;40534481;Victoria;"Erwin was a great host; he gave us brilliant directions to find his place and some advice about the best places to visit during our stay! Would recommend, AND visit again :D"

Al nostro arrivo non mancava nulla in casa, dall'aeroporto con i mezzi è comodissimo perché la fermata è proprio sotto casa.
Consigliato al 100%"
9556190;111192851;2016-10-30;97615128;Riccardo;Erwin ci ha accolti benissimo. Anche se il nostro inglese non è dei migliori, ci ha dato la sua piena disponibilità a trovare il necessario, su come muoverci nella città. Consigliato al 100%!

Vi blev taget godt imod af ejerens charmerende søn, som var meget imødekommende og hjælpsom. Alt var pænt og rent, omend med Amsterdams karakteristiske skævheder, hvilket vi fandt vældig morsomt!
Vi har helt sikkert tænkt os at booke dette hus igen!"

We really recommend her place. We would come back without a doubt.
Amsterdam is an amazing city."
14191780;116182955;2016-11-28;22798908;Ruben;"Margot's place is quiet, clean and good bangs for your bucks. With quick access to public transport the drop-in and take-off is as simple as it gets. Best suited if you want to stay away from the herd of tourists roaming the city - be a part of the city.

Note. Supermarket is nearby which makes it quire practic."
6428626;79739920;2016-06-14;6913419;David;Was a very nice stay at Onno's place. The apartment was clean and spacious , the public transport is around the corner and in this part of Amsterdam you can still park for free which is very rare.
12142094;97976683;2016-08-29;85591859;Natalie;We had a great stay in Amsterdam at Melissa's place. It was the perfect home away from home while traveling and in a good location. Melissa was very responsive and helpful in the lead up to our stay. I would definitely stay again!

Clean, bright, can comfortably  welcome 4 people. The tram is a minute from the apartment and the neighbourhood is full of different restaurants, you'll have the choice !
Everything was exactly as expected, even better ! 
Monika and Jonathan are very welcoming, thanks a lot to them ! :)"
3381145;22607569;2014-11-10;11958919;Elena;"We spent 3 nights as a group of 4 people in the Apartment of Jonathan and Monika.
We couldn't be happier with the whole experience.
The apartment has a great location and immediately gave us a welcoming feeling.

Jonathan and Monika were travelling themselves as well while we were guests at their apartment, so Jonathan instructed an agency to do the check-in/out. Both the communication with the agency and with Jonathan was very smooth and fast. We arrived quite late in Amsterdam, which also was no problem.
We had a very nice time in Amsterdam and can 100% recommend Jonathan&Monikas apartment."

71231;238981;2011-04-25;45286;Judy;Philipe was the perfect host, and his apartment was perfect - exactly as was promised!
71231;248633;2011-05-02;521425;Andrew;I didn't get to meet Philipe in person, unfortunately, but we arranged the rental by e-mail and over the phone, and everything worked out perfectly. The place was clean, well organized, and exactly as advertised. Additionally, Philipe provided excellent instructions. I didn't have any troubles with anything. It's an awesome location in great neighborhood. Thanks.
71231;388334;2011-07-22;433972;Jean;"We stayed in Philipe's apartment during the worst July weather in Amsterdam for 80 years! We were so glad to be in Philipe's comfortable apartment, which had everything needed to make a very wet week enjoyable - good bed, great TV & plenty of DVDs, a well equipped kitchen, central heating!! and great bars and cafes just a short distance away.
Much better than staying in a hotel and the area is preferable to the centre, as all the local bars etc are Dutch and not full of tourists. However it is easy to reach everywhere on foot, even for us and we are pensionistas.
Philipe gave us plenty of information, was always easy to contact and responded immediately. Throughly recommended."
71231;520255;2011-09-11;651089;Mike;"Our Stay in Amsterdam at Philipe's apartment was a great one. The location was perfect.Close to everything. The apartment was very comfortable and more than adequate with all the features of being in your own home. Philipe was the host with the most. Like a concierge in a 5 star hotel. He was very helpful in my being able to plan my stay in Amsterdam. And on my last day I was having trouble securing a taxi for my return trip to the airport. I called Philipe for help and  the issue was resolved in 20 minutes and the taxi arrived when requested as he assured me it would.  I would highy recomend ""The Amsterdam Experience"" to anyone. It was a great one for us.."
71231;819263;2011-12-31;1314937;Giovanna;Ringraziamo Philipe per l'ospitalità data gentillissimo bel soggiorno anche grazie al suo aiuto.
71231;1152655;2012-04-19;2049195;Beejan;"This was my first time using AirBnB.  Stayed here in April for 3 nights.  Philipe replies to emails quickly, many times within minutes.  Stayed in contact and called us when we arrived to Amsterdam to make sure we knew how to get around and scheduled when to meet.  He had a really busy day on our move in date, and still met us on time and took his time to show his place to us, never rushing.  He made it very simple if you don't want to wander around, printing us his home made manual of where to eat and what to do.  He has a killer dvd selection if you find it too cold to walk around one night and want to kick back on his couch.  (Anybody with Deerhunter on the movie shelf is ok by me.)  

His place - Off the main street, quiet, attractive and clean.  The pictures speak for themselves, very cool looking place.  Walk out the front door, you have pubs / restaurants / bazaars in every direction, walking.  Make sure to explore on foot, but the tram is also very near by to take you to Central or other places, very convenient. 

Thanks to Philipe for making our stay alot of fun, much better than staying in a hotel!"

The apartment is located in a quiet neigbourhood, but still close to all the main attractions: The tram is right across the street and there is a connection every five minutes. It takes less than ten minutes to get to the city center.
Jochem is a very kind host - a bottle of wine was ready for us when we arrived, that made us feel very welcome. He also had prepared a list of recommendations with museums, restaurants and parks, as it was our first visit to Amsterdam. Great host, perfect location, totally recommendable."

The location is perfect as the studio is a 2 minute walk away to the Metro (about 10 minutes to the City Center). Jochem gave us helpful information about his his place as well as recommendations for the city. The studio is simple but for exploring the city just ideal solution. 
A small supermarket is in front of the building (all student apartments). Only deficit was that we didn't have WLAN connection on our last day.
Thanks Jochem for being a good host!"

She welcomed us with a bottle of vine, chocholate and a fantastic (black) book with a description of all popular places in Amsterdam. Her place is even more beautiful than in pictures, and the neighbourhood is very trendy with a lot of cool places with food and drink. I would definitely recommend Irma's apartment!

Not only was their apartment a beautiful place to stay, but they had written up a super helpful guide for the city- things to do, places to go, where to eat, etc... It was a great way to see the city as less of a tourist and more like a local. Thanks so much!

3169338;13898025;2014-06-07;2155932;Dominique;Karine and Thomas were so hospitable with their lovely little apartment. It was small, but a very comfortable and gezellig home base for my boyfriend and I to explore Amsterdam from. Karine left us towels, museum cards, maps and other welcome treats to make our stay in Amsterdam just perfect. It was really great being able to stay so close to the Albert Kuyp market and we both really enjoyed staying in the Pijp neighbourhood. It was the perfect spot to explore all the sights from, especially the museums. Karine was so sweet and was very easy to stay in touch with, we would for definitely stay at the apartment again, next time hopefully longer!
3169338;75065092;2016-05-18;28760012;Pedro;"Our experience at Karine and Thomas apartment was just perfect. Everything went as expected and communication between us was always easy and friendly.  For us was like being at home.

The apartment is small but cozy and comfortable, with everything needed. Outside the apartment is even better with a great street marked, bars and restaurants. One of the best areas in all Amsterdam.

Hope I can go back as soon as possible and for sure, they will be my first choise. 

Thanks you both!"
6934517;110100896;2016-10-24;51517546;Anouk;Charlotte gave us a super warm welcome. Communication with her was very easy during our whole stay. Her appartment is super cosy and has a nice atmosphere. City center is super easy reachable by public transport or bike ofcourse. Would definitely recommend staying here

The apartment is OK in general and is well located in the center of Amsterdam. Some things can be improved - cleanliness, lights not working, squeaky bed, not enough cutlery.

it's a 15 minute walk to the Albert Cuyp market."

Une péniche à 1km du centre, le long de l'AMSTEL.
Très atypique, le bateau est super bien équipé, très propre et bien chauffé.
Des petites attentions supplémentaires (dosette à café, bouteille de vin), tout y est pour un séjour très agréable.
merci à nos hôtes pour cet accueil"
4696241;59762422;2016-01-15;13436831;Els;Fijn, ruim, schoon. Van alle gemakken voorzien. Mooie locatie. Prachtig uitzicht. Compleet. Zal deze plek zeker aanraden aan anderen!
4696241;63073642;2016-02-20;25953086;Fee;"Sandra made us feel very welcome and was really flexible about arrival and departure times. The boat was exactly as described - really spacious, comfortable and clean. It was also really toasty- which we were very grateful for as it was a VERY chilly week!

The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was great. We had everything we needed in the kitchen to prepare a meal (and a nice coffee) and the dishwasher/washing machine was really handy.

The Pijp is a very up and coming area full of good restaurants and independent shops. There's not a lot on the doorstep of the boat - but there's a supermarket within a 5-10 minute walk and a tram stop in to town. There are restaurants within a 15-20 minute walking distance so it's no hardship. We would definitely recommend the property and the area. Thank you Sandra!"
4696241;72944547;2016-05-05;24716983;Bill;Sandra and her houseboat were wonderful! Sandra was such a nice lady and she lives next door so she's there if you need help finding anything around town. The boat is huge and the beds are really comfortable. We were able to do some laundry there too which was helpful after 10 days in Europe. The location is great, a little further out than some other areas, but way less busy and still filled with options for food, coffee shops, shopping, etc. We would definitely recommend this spot.
4696241;104364886;2016-09-26;6956211;Naval;"all i can say for sandra's houseboat is that it is AMAZING just like her and her husband! thank you for having us! :)

COMING BACK SOON! :)"
4696241;127432939;2017-01-18;7178388;Olga;"We stayed at Sandra's place for a professional trip. We appreciated being all together for work and dinners, in the main big room, with a unique view on the Amstel River. The rooms and beds are really confortable. All the equipments are modern. Our guest have been welcoming and reactive. Great place to stay ; thanks a lot!"

Op amper 15 minuutjes te voet van de RAI expo."
327089;11905363;2014-04-18;9768065;Moazam;I stayed at Helga's place for 5 nights on my business trip to Amsterdam. Helga and Patrick are very friendly and helped me with directions and places to see in Amsterdam. The breakfast served is superb, Patrick makes fabulous Capuccino! He is also a Bob Dylan fan and has a huge collection of Bob Dylan music he ever did. The room is spacious and big and the adjacent washroom is immaculately clean and large. The location is great, 7 mins walk from the Zuid station, very close to the RAI conference centre. The tram station to take the tram to the center is about 5 mins or a metro from the Zuid station. Great hosts and shall return!
327089;71773842;2016-04-28;18983862;Jody;"Helga and Patrick took great care of me, serving a copious breakfast each morning and providing me with helpful advice about sites in Amsterdam. Patrick even tracked me down at a neighborhood cafe when I made the erroneous assumption that I needed a key for an inside door.  In fact, I wasn't locked out -- all I needed to do was push! 

The location of this property is ideal. It's only one stop from Schiphol Airport and walking distance from Station Zuid to the house. It's equally convenient to get to the Museum Plein and central city on the trams, which run frequently. The street is quiet which I found to be a welcome contrast from the tourist-filled central city. (Yes, I do appreciate the irony of this statement from a tourist.)

Altogether, I highly recommend this site -- good people, good location, comfortable accommodation."
8216398;71236467;2016-04-24;14179648;Mélanie;The truck was cosy, warm and comfortable !! It's very easy to go to the center by bus. It's an original way to visit Amsterdam !!! :)

The room and bed are comfortable, location is perfect, from one side you can simply go to the centre by foot, from another- there's quiet at night. there's nice park near the house. lovely apartment!!!!
767326;16550808;2014-07-29;15642213;Evgeny;"Many thanks to Monique for her hospitality and kindness!
Room and whole house was as described - great, nice and clean. House is situated in pleasant disctict near Vondel park, with many tram stops so we have no any diffuculties to get into city center or vice versa - to P&R Parking. In both cases it takes about 15-30 minutes. 
There is other beautiful resident in the house - cat. As Anna said it is the best cat in the world! :)
So we definitely recommend this apartment.

best regards 
Evgeny and Anna"
767326;30561982;2015-04-24;14951941;Atanas;"Monique's place is a nice flat located in walking distance city of center. Vondelpark is just 10 min away and after another 10 min you can find yourself at Museumplein where are Van Gog museum, Stedelijk museum, Rijksmuseum. Also close is a neighborhood with many bars, restaurants, cafes if not counting a few quite nice cafes and bars, food store, just behind the corner.
The apartment is cozy and spacious. On top of that there is Tiger cat who is very friendly, adorable pet."
767326;32512645;2015-05-19;10723283;Gitarani;"Monique is an extremely nice host. We had a wonderful stay at her place. She welcome us warmly and gave us everything we need to enjoy Amsterdam; the map and the coupon for Amsterdam attractions as well. 

The location is quite calm and very easy to find (it's on the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps anyway) and only takes 10 minutes walk from the closest tram. It takes for about 40 minutes from the airport by public transportation, 10-15 minutes to the central by tram. There are many restaurants and supermarket near the apartment.

Me and my Mum really love the room. It's in a clean condition, spacier than we though and the good news is she has extra blanket! :) The bathroom and kitchen are clean as well. She has two adorable pets named Tiger (a cat) and Kaya (a dog), they're so cute especially Kaya which always feels excited all the time.

What else to say but we had a wonderful time stayed at your place and enjoy Amsterdam though only for two days. Thank you Monique! Let me know if you would like to explore Indonesia someday. Hope to see another time !"
767326;96292944;2016-08-22;22484752;Luana;Posizione dell'appartamento super strategica e comodissima per il tram 1. La stanza è piccolina ma ha tutto quel che serve, in camera c'è un bagno con solo doccia e lavandino utilizzati dalla proprietaria solo in nostra assenza, il water si trova nella stanzina accanto alla camera. Monique è gentilissima, si interessa della tua giornata, offre consigli su cosa fare e ci ha permesso di lasciare i bagagli da lei per tutto il giorno di partenza avendo l'aereo alle 9 di sera. Buonissimo anche il collegamento con l'aeroporto, in una mezz'ora ci si arriva. Sicuramente in caso di ritorno ad Amsterdam aggiorneremo di nuovo qui.

Neighbourhood is really good and above all we felt safe at all times, which is an important factor when travelling.

Apartment is as it had been advertised & is very modern and practical & not a lot of noise from the street.
Location is very good - only 15mins walk from the centre of Amsterdam. There are also buses and trams just around the corner which bring you to the city centre or to other quarters eg Museum quarter only a few stops away.

Host was also very laid back and there was no rush vacating the apartment on the day we were leaving, which was helpful."
1527443;75756360;2016-05-22;10527970;Tugce;We had a great time at Marjolein & Arne's house. We've felt at home since we arrived there and in total it was a great experience.  Highly recommended, see you next time!

4 of us stayed for a friends surprise birthday weekend away to Amsterdam. The apartment is in a very quiet area with easy access to the busy city centre (we got the bus from around the corner). It was very tidy, spacious & homely with everything we needed and more! BBQ / coffee machine / roof terrace with table & chairs / walk in shower / his & hers sink.. what a treat.

At Marjolein's request, we made every effort to be quiet at night as the walls are thin and its a quiet neighbourhood. This was fine as we were only here for 2 nights and we went out for the evenings.

Excellent experience, we would stay here again."

Thanks Inez for making our trip so easy and comfortable :)"
1842012;39028282;2015-07-20;29362301;Heidi & Anthony;Janeke was flexible with arranging a meeting point between one of her friends & us since we arrived late. It was also nice to be able to stay for as long as we needed on the day we left. When we arrived the place was clean & cosy, there were some well needed snacks & wine waiting for us which made us feel extra welcome! We loved the neighbourhood & the view. The description was good, it's a great place for a young couple :) We had some mishaps but Janeke was good at helping us out.

13012178;78485941;2016-06-07;28538465;Ciat;"Pyrola and Maarten were wonderful and made us feel perfectly at home when we arrived. The house is beautiful and spacious, and their kids have made some fantastic legos in the basement. The area is also quite lovely, only fifteen-twenty minutes to the centre by bus, and a nice break from the city; as you can see from the pictures, there's a wonderful view and greenery everywhere. 

The apartment has two showers and a bath, which came in handy when we were in a rush and had four people who all needed to take showers. The espresso machine was also a nice touch. 

They also left detailed directions of how to get to the bus and ferry, their routes, as well as recommendations of things to do and place to see; the bottle of wine they left was lovely as we sat out on the porch watching the sunset our first day.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience staying as Pyrola and Maarten's guests, and if I'm back again, I hope to stay with them in the future!"

It is also close to the center, perfect location for biking or walking to the center. Also very well connected with public transportations. 
Leon is a super kind guy! I definitely recommend this place."
4059685;65395787;2016-03-13;7502185;Susie;Leon was really helpful and gave us excellent directions to his place. The flat was great, really clean and in a great location. Leon kept in touch with us via watsapp and made sure we were comfortable. Great place to stay, everything you need and loads of lovely places to eat nearby!
4059685;105605066;2016-10-02;58192064;Clewis;Leon's place was fantastic. Very quick walk from tram and Vondelpark. Leon was very helpful with providing direction and information on getting into his place. Highly recommended.

7297044;44669489;2015-08-28;39010518;Francesca;"Our stay in the apartment was simply perfect. The appartment itself is better than the photos; it is so light and airy yet felt so comfortable and welcoming. We really felt at home and sometimes it was hard to feel motivated to even leave especially as we had bad weather on our trip. 
It was really obvious that Hugo paid a lot of attention to the small details to provide us with everything we would need and I especially loved his list of restaurant recommendations away from the tourist ones. The location is perfect; the appartment is in the heart of the city yet located on a quiet side street. Central station is a 5 minute walk and all other attractions are a short walking distance. 
Hugo was very helpful and always available to answer any questions. I would definitely recommend staying here you won't regret it!"

1339705;70730202;2016-04-20;42187558;Jennifer;"The apartment is indeed a designer apartment. It has been beautifully fitted out, is large, comfortable, fully equipped, has lift access and, unusually for an apartment, there are windows on all 4 sides so there is plenty of light coming in.  It has lovely views over the canal on one side and the communal gardens to the rear.  The apartment is within easy walking distance of the main tourist attractions, yet inside the apartment it was very quiet.  
Mechtelien was helpful and charming and was waiting for us on our arrival. She kept in touch with us by text during our stay. We would not hesitate to recommend this apartment as a place to stay in Amsterdam."
1339705;73322863;2016-05-08;45599609;Butler;"The apartment was wonderful!  It was very quiet and in a great location; it was also much bigger than we expected.  Mechtelien was very helpful in answering all questions that we had.  We would definitely stay here again."
1339705;82061043;2016-06-26;16104709;Rachel;Our host was patiently waiting for us at the apartment after our flight was delayed. She showed us around the apartment which was just as described but perhaps the pictures do not do it justice - it is so spacious and lovely.
9146453;53551602;2015-11-09;47839723;Amber;We had a great experience with our first stay using Air B&B, Akko our host went out of his way to help us! When we got there and it was raining, we were a little bit lost so he came and met us where we were to bring us to the apartment which was a lovely and very helpful gesture. The apartment was gorgeous, very clean and we were made to feel so welcome there (we were even left a complimentary bottle of wine!) it was in the perfect location and the next day, although we checked out at 12pm, Akko let us leave our suitcases in the basement as our flight wasn't until 7pm that evening which made it a lot easier for us and our 'tourist day' around the City. Thank you so much for having us, we would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Amsterdam in the near future :)
9146453;57571575;2015-12-27;50202297;Johan;"I went to Amsterdam with a buddy of mine over Christmas. We decided we wanted to stay at A's place for the location, but we were very unsure as of how to get there. Luckily A has great knowledge of the city and the public transport, and did not hesitate to explain the trip for us beforehand - big applause for being so friendly. He greated us with a smile once we arrived and showed us the appartment. 

Am very glad to have booked this place. We enjoyed our stay very much. And I should mention, the next door coffeeshop (literally the neighboor), is great! Very professional compared to the others around.

I must say, as everyone else has said, the stairs are indeed VERY steep - we we're two guys 20 years old, and we found them troubling... :P"
9146453;61582412;2016-02-06;7160687;Marie;"The apartment is perfectly located and exactly as described in the pictures. Having to go through the tattooshop undoubtedly adds to the charm of the place. The street is full of nice shops and coffees.
Akko is a very welcoming host ready to answer all your questions.
I'll definitely book the apartment again if I come back to Amsterdam."
9146453;65081226;2016-03-10;16287005;Andreas;"Akko was very friendly, told us how we could reach his place. Perfect location and very central; everything you need for a couple of days is being provided. Clean, comfy bed. Nice kitchen, TV with Netflix ... 
Be aware that the door to the bathroom is more or less just a paravent; just saying just in case your not comfy with sitting on the toilet 2m next to your loved ones ;) - but we didn't mind."
9146453;70934361;2016-04-22;64342705;Emma;"We had a wonderful 48 hours in Amsterdam, Akko's apartment was spacious, clean and well equipped with everything you would need. The stairways were steep (as we had read in previous reviews) but no problem at all, only adding to the charm of the building.
The area is perfectly situated for convenience in getting to all the museums/shops/main attraction/bars & restaurants.
We will be revisiting this beautiful city and would be very happy to find availability here again, Thanks Akko!"

The crazy stairs would not be for everyone, so keep this in mind.  We loved the adventure and the exercise they provided.   Akko was so friendly and helpful, from the time the reservation was made until our departure.  We can't wait to get back to Amsterdam and to stay in Akko's place again!

С видом на канал и парк. Видно, что недавно сделан ремонт. Очень хороший матратц и подушки! Мы были с ребёнком ( 1 год) и для него бесплатно предоставили детскую кроватку. В гостиной была детская железная дорога, которой мы с удовольствием играли. Natasha , разрешила пользоваться всеми специями , маслом и посудой, что очень удобно. В доме за углом есть небольшой магазин. Недалёко от остановки трамвая есть супермаркет LIDL и JUMBO, в которых можно купить любые продукты, включая некоторые аптечные препараты ( от боли/ аллергии/ насморка). На трамвае номер 1 и 17 можно доехать до центра города за несколько минут. Либо до центра можно прогуляться пешком вдоль канала. Квартира замечательная! Если появится возможность, то с удовольствием вернёмся. Рекомендую!!!

Her apartment is beautiful, it was an amazing place to stay for a long weekend in the City - very spacious, comfortable, clean and really nice decor. The garden was a nice surprise - and was far bigger than anticipated. 

Would definitely recommend!"
5332142;50717814;2015-10-13;45849665;Ingelies;We troffen het goed met dit zeer verzorgde appartement met terrastuin. Na enig stoeien met de techniek (ik ben niet zo handig) kregen we de tv aan de praat. Ik heb genoten van het lekker diepe ligbad. Helaas hadden de buren net de eerste nacht een feest, (waar ze netjes een briefje over hadden gepost) dus het was wel erg lawaaierig die nacht maar dat hoort ook een beetje bij de grote stad he? Het was heerlijk om weer even te genieten van Amsterdam en dan nog wel met zulk stralend weer!
1197874;6197192;2013-08-03;1559542;Gracen;We couldn't have asked for a better place, location, or host in Amsterdam than we experienced in our stay with Wieneke. Her flat is bright, comfortable, and cozy. The balcony access is excellent. The location is perfect for those looking for less touristy travel. You can access the centre easily by transit and bicycle and return to a quiet neighbourhood near the lovely Erasmuspark in the evenings. Wieneke was an amazing host - great fun to chat with, learn from, and gather tips and recommendations from. She's also very cool on her racing bike :)
1197874;8692650;2013-11-12;9291999;Raymond;Actually i would say the house we rent was nice and the same as depicted, the location was good as well. Wieneke is also a nice person, we enjoyed our stay in amsterdam.
1197874;23664703;2014-12-07;23485878;Lindsay;Wieneke was an absolute delight to stay with. She was very welcoming and was so helpful, explaining much to us about Amsterdam and making sure we could get around easily. She was very organized and provided maps and brochures for the sights we were interested in seeing during our visit. Her flat was  clean, warm, cozy and well situated - only a few minutes from central station and very easy access to and from the city center. We enjoyed Wieneke very much and recommend her listing to anyone looking for a nice quiet retreat after long chilly days exploring the beautiful city of Amsterdam!
1197874;28133981;2015-03-18;28147043;Jael;"Overall it had been a good experience! 

The area is 20 mins to the city which is good if you like a local residential feel that is non touristy (perfect for us). It has two supermarkets nearby so it's convenient to get stuff. The place is cosy and has a nice vintage 1930's feel.

Wieneke is very friendly and helpful - giving us an overview of the city, transport arrangements etc she knew I came from Singapore that is hot and is adapting to the cold so she turned up the heater. Also she cooked soup for herself and cooked extra portions for us which is great in the cold weather. She also lent us her travel cards and even walked to help me top it up as the machine does not accept international credit cards. 

Happy :)"
1197874;42476485;2015-08-13;8223015;Phillip;Weineke is a very generous and helpful host and we really enjoyed our stay in her place. The room is very quiet and comfortable. Loved the balcony looking out on to the green space. The kitchen and laundry  were nice amenities to have available. The location was easy to find with the good directions provided. Her place is very close to the tram and bus lines so easy to visit all the sights. We recommend her place for your stay in Amsterdam.
1197874;71699969;2016-04-27;51637736;Claire;Wieneke was amazing! Such a wonderful host. So helpful, so friendly, and she always made me and my friend feel super comfortable. The room itself was great-- spacious, clean, plenty of clean towels and linens, and extra comforters in case we got cold. Quiet, safe neighborhood that's just a quick 15 min drive outside the center of Amsterdam. Highly recommend!
9839452;93817772;2016-08-14;87943336;Hasan;Jasper is a totally awesome man, very sweet and openhearted. He's really chill and gave us perfect instruction to get around the town or the nearest supermarket. His place totally kicks ass!! you will not regret a single penny living at his place!!! Had an awesome jump from his balcony and swam with the ducks. We would love to come back and stay there again.

4180798;62611696;2016-02-15;53185432;Daisy;Erik and his flat mate Jack were exceptional hosts. Rose let us into the flat and made us feel at home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and thank you to Erik and jack for their hospitality. Would defintiley go back & stay there again, location is unbeatable!

L'accès à l'appartement par le biais de son smartphone est très pratique et le voisinage est plutot calme.

Rapport qualité/prix très intéressant pour 4 personnes ; adresse à recommander."

5042861;56194943;2015-12-10;48439714;Sandy;"L'appartement est conforme aux descriptions, très bien situé près d'un des plus jolis parcs d'Amsterdam. Le système d'accès à l'appartement est un peu compliqué mais Joel a été immédiatement disponible pour nous aider par téléphone (il faut appeler le numéro pour ouvrir la porte, la porte s'ouvre directement, puis il faut rappeler ce numéro pour ouvrir la seconde porte intérieure).
Appartement très confortable et fonctionnel, petits problèmes avec la wifi et manque d'une couverture si une personne dort sur le canapé.
Très bon séjour dans un joli appartement, et dans une ville où les activités ne manquent pas (musées, parcs, balades en vélo, sur les canaux, bars et restaurants)"
5042861;96406583;2016-08-22;6231589;Lisa;"Apartment was a good size, fairly well equipped for our stay, and in a good location (within walking distance to Tram 1 and Leidseplein). Joel was also able to accommodate our late arrival. There were some hygiene issues; but having raised them with Joel directly, he said that he would address them asap."
5042861;107767989;2016-10-12;1453941;John (Jack);I stayed here for business this week and it was ideal. Nice big space, with a comfy bed. Couldn't ask for much more.
5042861;111385295;2016-10-31;50642489;Valérie;"L'hôte est invisible. L'appartement est conforme, mais on sent que le minimum est fait : bricolage de l'aménagement, fuite d'eau dangereuse puisque l'eau tombe sur les prises électriques (lors de la douche ou de l'utilisation de l'évier). Quartier sympa. Déco agréable mais qui masque mal le côté ""business"" de la location. Plaque électrique minimim et vieille, même pas branché. Grand lave-vaisselle inutile vu le peu de vaisselle à disposition. Même pas une passoire. Pas un balai ni une serpillère (dommage pour éponger la salle de bains après la douche, car malgré la porte de la cabine de douche, cela déborde)."
5042861;125894306;2017-01-08;65606593;Leonardo;"Joel gave us a really helpful description on how to get to the apartment and how to get inside. When we arrived, everything was really neat and clean. The bed even had chocolates on the pillows, and there was complimentary champagne in the fridge. 

Near the neighborhood, you will find coffee shops, restaurants (Foodhallen is 7 minutes away) and a mini market open until 2 am.  Central Station and the airport are 30 minutes away in a tram."
5042861;136795021;2017-03-12;14752161;Ilayda;This was my first bad experience with airbnb! There were construction workers in the building at 11.30 pm and you enter the house from inside a computer shop, they moved stuff at 12 pm!!! And when we asked the host why they were strangers in the apartment at that time of the night he was PLAIN RUDE!! All would have been fine if he agreed to pay at least half of our money back because we had to stay in a hotel afterwards (we felt very uncomfortable with his attitude, and he didnt answer our phone calls) but oh no, he just stopped the commumication entirely :) I donor reccomend this house to anyone.
5042861;138151462;2017-03-19;118361311;Jennyfer;Bon emplacement mais très petit. Fenêtre recouverte d'un film plastique horrible donc pas de vu. Salle de bain sans fenêtre. Réveille samedi à 8h Pcq travaux effectuer juste en dessous super!!! Hôte absent. Lit super!!!

441639;12809778;2014-05-12;5039220;Anorte;Sannes place was just great! A lovely flat right at the station only 5 minutes to the city center. We were welcomed and provided with all kinds of information. A great host in a lovely flat.
441639;13644348;2014-06-02;10103542;Katja;"Wir können Sanne nur aufs Höchste weiterempfehlen, Superkontakt, gute Kopenhagentipps(speziell das Restaurant Höst mit neuer skandinavischer Küche und exzellentem Service). Die Wohnung ist einfach toll, viel Platz und alles das man für einen angenehmen Aufenthalt benötigt. Verkehrsanbindung ist sehr gut 10 min. bis zum Zentrum und leicht zu finden. Ruhige Umgebung mit einem sehr netten Frühstückscafe (auch Sanne´s Lieblingsplatz).
Tja wer immer auch Kopenhagen besuchen möchte dem kann man nur sagen. ""Stay with Sanne"""
441639;38374110;2015-07-15;11877508;Inger;Sannes leilighet var helt perfekt for vår lille familie, og Sanne var en veldig hjelpsom og søt vertinne. Leiligheten har en fin beliggenhet og er veldig godt utstyrt. Vi satte spesielt stor pris på den store balkongen og hjemmelaget pesto og marmelade.
441639;40037793;2015-07-27;38996020;K Weeby;"This was a wonderful place to stay for our first trip to Copenhagen. And our host Sanne was incredibly accommodating and helpful to us considering our last minute booking. She provided us with a detailed guestbook but was also always on hand in case we needed any extra advice or assistance. 
Home is beautiful and beautifully kept and very close to a useful S-Train station (which was pretty much how we got everywhere we needed to go - just a few stops from the central station). There are places to stop and have coffee/have a nice meal in the nearby area if needs be. 

All in all a truly pleasant experience."
441639;69572490;2016-04-11;42118739;Lizzie;"Sanne has been a perfect host - the flat was immaculate when we arrived, she answered all of our questions immediately and we based our whole trip around her recommendations which were spot on. Pick of the keys was easy and Sanne came to check us out in person at our requested time which worked well. Sanne left us lots of bedding and towels and the fact that we could use things like olive oil for cooking etc made a big difference. 

 The flat itself is great - so close to Valby station which is only a few stops from central. Ths shop at the end of the road was very convenient too. The flat is furnished really well and the sun balcony is a godsend. We have come back to the uk ready to refurbish our house now!  

Thanks for making our weekend break so memorable!"
441639;142762128;2017-04-09;115206036;Rebecca;Sanne's apartment is beautiful and in a great location where you can easily travel to other areas of Copenhagen. She left us lots of really helpful information which we used throughout our stay, including some great restaurant recommendations. We'd recommend staying here!

Not last for the proximity of the Kaffebar which is the most adorable little cafe you can imagine. Had breakfast there twice :)

Communication was superfast and friendly and we could not have wished for better hosts :*

Thanks again, we'd come back anytime :)

17876318;141073077;2017-04-02;16918658;Tif & Manu;We really enjoyed our stay a Helene's place. She was very friendly and kind. She gave us a list of vegan options in Copenhagen.

The kitchen was so nice,  with everything you need. Aldo the apartment is not in the center of the city, there are great stores, and bakeries in the area. Helene was very welcoming and gave us great tips of what to do in Copenhagen. She was also very flexibel about our checkout time. Something we appreciated a lot. A very recommended place to stay!
17687518;148782704;2017-05-01;113487926;Gergely;Caroline's apartment is very warm and clean, the elegance of the Danish taste makes you really feel at home. She is very welcoming and available, we had a great weekend and we would be happy to go back sometimes! Absolutely recommended!
17687518;153188647;2017-05-20;124378127;Sabino;Ottimo appartementino in una zona strategica, per via della vicinanza al centro città , alla spiaggia e a tutti i luoghi d'interesse principali, il tutto é dovuto alla vicinanza della casa a mezzi pubblici pubblici come la linea metro e pullman principali , vicinanza anche di vari servizi tipo supermercati , negozi h24 etc etc , casa molto pulita , Caroline molto premurosa e fa decisamente un ottimo lavoro per aiutarvi in qualsiasi modo.
9382943;70884151;2016-04-21;46235414;Stephan;The apartment location is very central. Tivoli gardens are less than 5 mn away by walking. The apartment is really safe and quiet. As described on the pictures, it is cosy, well equipped and nicely decorated (it was fully refurbished a few months ago). Lisa and Rasmus were really nice hosts. They provided us with 2 bikes, wich were our unique way of transportation during our stay. They also recommended us some local restaurant. When we will stay in Copenhagen again, we will definitely stay there again :)

18055588;156625452;2017-05-31;89955572;Anthea;Our family had four enjoyable days in Copenhagen staying at Stig's apartment. The apartment was everything we needed - it is spacious, clean and well equipped. The location worked well being very close to a metro station and a small supermarket and is within walking distance of most sites. Communication with Stig was easy and friendly - we would definitely recommend this apartment.
7434630;103145351;2016-09-20;24722351;Jodi;Very good communication from the host, the apartment was very conveniently located for a range of activities.

6509916;37096768;2015-07-04;36501337;Elisabeth;Vi hadde gode dager i Rikkes leilighet. Leiligheten var fresh og fin, og alt var på stell. Flott bakgård. Området var bra, med nydelig park, lekeplass og god matbutikk rett ved. Godt utgangspunkt for å komme seg rundt i byen med buss og tog. Rikke var også lett å kontakte da vi lurte på et par ting. Bare pluss.
13122785;88849852;2016-07-25;1976360;Sabrina;"Die Unterkunft hat mit dafür gesorgt, dass wir einen unvergesslichen Urlaub in Kopenhagen verbringen durften. 
Der Kontakt im Vorfeld war unkompliziert und nett. Auch die  Schlüsselübergabe verlief problemlos. 
Die Wohnung entspricht ganz und gar den Bildern. Von der Größe super für drei Personen geeignet. Alles einfach perfekt für uns."
4260055;23405675;2014-11-30;6932265;Alexa;"I had a pleasant stay at Gittas flat.
Marie, her friend, is lovely and gave us the keys to the flat.

It is 60 stairs up, and has a living room, bedroom, kitchen and toilet/shower.

There is a kettle if you want tea or coffee in the kitchen.
If you need a microwave, I didn't see one while there but it wasn't a big deal.

Regarding the bedroom, it's a comfortable size, but there wasn't really much space to put your own clothes (short stay so I lived out of my suitcase instead).
I'm quite sensitive skinned, and the bedding/quilt was rather rough to the skin, which made it uncomfortable to sleep in for me.

The walls are thick but the floors are thin, I mention this because one of the nights we were staying there, the neighbors diagonally below from us were playing loud music/partying late into the night, so it took a long time to get to sleep.

The flat does warm up quite nicely.
I would stay again but I found the price a tad steep (£149 for 2 nights) which would be equivalent to some hotel prices."
4260055;39754292;2015-07-26;32219755;Maddie;My sister and I stayed in Gitta's apartment for a long weekend and were very pleased with the choice. The space was in a great location (shops and restaurants that were close but on a quiet street), very clean, and looked even better than it did in the photos! Staying in such a lovely home made our trip to Copenhagen even better than we imagined :)
4260055;43944829;2015-08-23;2580916;Oliver;"Marie, the key manager was in the flat when we arrived. She showed us the flat and gave us some hints where to have dinner in the evening. The flat so was soooo cool and met my expectation regarding the design and flair of Scandinavia. Bright, sunny, clean. Very nice furnitures and pictures - simply great.
The area around is very quite - but only a five minute walk and you find restaurants, bars and supermarket. Also the walk to the Tivoli or city center is easy when you like to walk. 
Only the bathroom is very small, but it worked out. 
I can recommend this appartment by 120 % - great great great!!"
4260055;45061300;2015-08-31;21452977;Michaela;our stay at Gittas apartment was fantastic! We got the keys easily. The apartment was immaculate- clean and decorated wonderfully. The bed was comfortable and we loved being able to walk to the nearby shops and cafes. We are athletic so we loved to run around the water nearby. We will definitely stay here again!! I highly recommend this place.
4260055;47804369;2015-09-21;33934788;Kate;What a privilege to stay in such a wonderful apartment. We had lots of  useful information from Gitta before our stay, and had a lovely welcome from Anna when we arrived. Flat is in a great location near to some great shops and cafes, but you still can get some peace and quiet too. We wished we could have stayed longer! Thank you again!
4260055;49454379;2015-10-04;12256179;Sam;I didn't meet Gitta but I met her friend Mary who was incredibly helpful, sweet, and responsive. The apartment is clean, airy, and absolutely beautiful! perhaps even nicer than the photos, and it has everything you would need and more (plus speakers!!). The neighborhood of Frederiksberg is quiet and genuinely local with few tourists around, giving you a real feel of what it would be to live in Copenhagen. It is about a twenty minute walk to the center of town but with a bicycle you will notice how truly small the city is, making everything only a stones throw away. I would highly recommend staying at Gitta's apartment but do note that it is a 3rd floor walk up, so pack light :)
4260055;53364292;2015-11-08;6874171;Louise;I had once again a really nice stay in Gitta and Niels' apartment. Clean, bright and perfect location. And they are very helpful. I hope to come back again soon.

Some really cute little streets full of bars and restaurants only a few minutes away from the apartment, and then 10/15 mins or so walk to the centre. All the little things were provided as well, maps, leaflets for places to go, and a bit of food in the fridge. Thank you!

We didn't meet Tamey till the day after we arrived but he contacted me in advance and was available on the phone to make sure we had everything we needed. When we caught up with him in the morning we had a good chat over some coffee while he gave us the lowdown on all the places to visit in town. Such a sweet guy and a thoughtful host!

Lastly, having the bikes available is an amazing idea, it just makes getting into town and sightseeing an absolute breeze. 

Thanks for having us Tamey!"

5725296;35595271;2015-06-20;35086892;Tinja;Asunto oli saman tyyppinen kuin kuvista voi päätellä, siisti, tyylikäs, viihtyisä, toimiva keittiö missä oli kaikki tarvittavat ja mukava sänky. Ihan asunnon edestä meni busseja tiheään tahtiin joten kulkeminen oli helppoa vaikka asunto ei ihan keskustassa ollutkaan. Asuinalue oli rauhallinen ja turvallisen oloinen. Jonas oli jättänyt myös hyviä vinkkejä missä kannattaa syödä ja käydä, ja miten toimia pyörien, keittiön sun muun kanssa. Kiitos Jonas moitteettomasta ja viihtyisästä käynnistä, kävisin ilman muuta uudestaan!
8031995;81569996;2016-06-23;65581531;Gaz;"Kept in communication well as stay drew nearer. The apartment was about 20 mins walk from train station, but you can sit by lakes and chill on the way. 
On arrival, Cirkeline was really welcoming and good to chat to. I like her, she seems fun. She showed me round the apartment. It is homely and familiar, it was perfect for me. The room had a huge bed and that was fine with me. The apartment is also close to various shops...and I found couple of cool bars close by which ruined my shopping errands :) 

Had a brief but good stay, really liked Cirkeline, and hope to keep in touch and have a beer with you some time."

The apartment itself is just really beautiful with a lot of character. You have everything you need and much more. I could have stayed the whole day on the sofa to read all the books I always wanted to read (not enough time and not enough knowledge of Danish though :) )
There is a supermarket just over the street and a lot of chances to eat outside as well. The bus stop in front of the door brings you to the city and train station in just 15 minutes.
Pernille and her family were away but the communication before was great and we got perfect directions how to get to the apartment. We got the key from the neighbors which also were really nice. 
I could only recommend this place and would definitely stay there again!

Thanks Pernille for letting us stay!"

We did not meet Timm but met his girlfriend Anita who was very friendly. Timm was very hospitable and provided us with complimentary drinks and fruit which was lovely to arrive to.

Highly recommend staying here."

Carsten er kjempehyggelig og imøtekommende. Vi fikk jordbær og vin når vi kom, en hyggelig omvisning i leiligheten og masse tips om hvor vi burde gå i København. Leiligheten stod til forventningene. Den er stor og fin og har alt du trenger av fasiliteter. 

Et lite minus er at det ikke er noen gardiner. Dette gjør at leiligheten er veldig lys om natten. Vi løste det fint med sovemasker.

Vi var seks jenter som koste oss maks her og vi kan absolutt anbefale denne leiligheten videre!"

There were two bikes we could use (in Copenaghen is very useful!)
Dorota was easy to communicate with and despite not being available at check-in provided clear instructions and useful recommendations. 
I would recommend his flat."

His apartment held all the comforts of home and is perfect for 1-2 people. The location couldn't be better. Tons of cute shops and restaurants around. I highly recommend getting a kebab while you are there because it's some of the best I have ever had."

Jeanette was a helpful host answering questions and facilitating our stay.  The rooms were light and airy and the apartment was very clean. One of our favourite moments, was sitting at the dining table with our 2 boys in the early evening light, listening to Nina Simone on the turntable, with a cold beer and delicious fish and chips from the restaurant around the corner - it felt like a real home from home.  Thank you for making us so welcome.

There was two supermarket in the near too. We could use the inventory and had a nice breakfast on the big balcony. All in all we had a really nice stay.

Det var deilig og stille, selv om det var i et område med mye trafikk. All kontakt med verten var hyggelig og raskt. Line svarte kjapt på alle våre spørsmål, var imøtekommende i forhold til våre ønsker og fleksibel når vi hadde behov for å gjøre en liten forandring. Vi kan godt tenke oss å bruke denne leiligheten ved et senere besøk i København og anbefaler den varmt for andre. Det var også supert at det var en parkeringsplass for oss.

The bed is really comfy and the kitchen well equipped for a small space. The powerful shower was always hot - but keep in mind it's a very compact wet room/loo.

The area was great, we hired bikes to get around and the buses and public transport were really easy. We had some great meals and drinks in the neighbourhood - Nørrebro is a cool place to hang out.

Would recommend for a couple of people wanting to experience the real CPH."

William nous a très bien accueillies et des spécialités culinaires nous attendaient.
En revanche le seul point négatif du logement fut la propreté.
Ménage non fait malgré les frais à notre charge.
Salle de bain de petite taille mal agencée pleine de poussière et de saletés surtout au niveau des toilettes et du sol de la douche.
Cuisine fonctionnelle mais sol et évier sales..."

William was helpful throughout - responding to all questions, and the snacks were a thoughtful touch. Lots of supermarkets nearby for food essentials. The bathroom was quite tight and it and the kitchen could have been cleaner but, for me, this place has more positives than negatives. Thanks William!

The location was great for exploring the city, and offered everything we needed - hot shower, reliable wifi, kitchen amenities etc. The bed was quite small but very comfortable. Although Kristian could not be there when we arrived, he arranged for a friend to meet us and give us access to the apartment, and was readily available via messaging for the entirety of our stay. We would happily recommend Kristian as a host - thanks again!
1643334;85279949;2016-07-11;4736382;Nassa;Kristian was a lovely host with a lovely apartment in a lovely area... Lovely lovely lovely. His apartment is located right next to the Norrebro bridge and that means you are very close to everything usually we rent bikes, but we didn't need to, because of the location. His kitchen is fully equipped and you can have a lovely weekend in his great apartment. Kristian was a super host who helped us and explained us a lot. I'm very happy we stayed there and I can recommend him as a host : )

The apartment is very well located, near the metro and train station and bus stops.  You can also walk to the city center if you want. Our main problems were: -small bed for 2 people, -spiders and little bugs, -flaws in the ceiling of the room. Although the bath was clean, the worn shower made it look dirty. I recommend it if you plan to visit Copenhagen and you want to sleep in a cozy apartment.

Peter and Olivia were very welcoming and kindly left city maps, a guide book and their own recommendations for places to eat and drink - all of which were really helpful. Peter was also very helpful in advising us of the best/easiest way to get from the airport (which is very easy, by the way). Highly recommended!

I arrived and this place is on a hidden side street luckily a woman let me use her wi fi and I called this guy a number of times with no answer on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) finally when he answered he says Felix will be there shortly.  I had to wait in the freezing cold for quite some time close to an hour for him to arrive.  When he got there he didn't even know which door to open and which flat I was to stay in when he finally figured it out the place was dirty trash laying around dirty dishes in the sink bed was dirty not washed and random laundry laying around in bags he told me someone would be by shortly to clean I waited and waited and because of my flights I was tired so I had to sleep fully clothed with face cover as I don't know who stayed in this bed prior to me.  Hours later some ppl arrived and left because I was sleeping and I left shortly there after early in the morning.  I host and I use air Bnb because we are a community that's supposed to take care of one another and in this instance I wasn't taken care of and I will not ever stay here or suggest anybody does.  This is by far the most unprofessional interaction I've had with any host and I've stayed at places around the world.

The apartment is alright. We just slept there so that's fine. Its not a fancy one but it does it's job. :D 
The only sad thing was the shower .. running very low. It took forever to get wet. 
The couch was alright to sleep on, not that comfy though. 
The staircases are very narrow, but luckily at our arrival we had a very nice host who helped us with the luggage. 
The whole arrival and communication was great. The apartment is kinda hidden since there is no number 3, but we just gave em a call and it went smoothly. 
All in all the price is worth the apartment. I would visit again .. but only for like 2 nights and sleeping .. if u come out to party for a weekend .. book this  apartment .. ;)"

The beautyfull district ""De Pijp"", which has a lot to offer, there are many Bars, Restaurants and a nice Streetmarket, is  just a short walk away. We really enjoyed our stay at Piet´s place!"

We especially enjoyed the little outdoor area on the 2nd floor to get some fresh air.

One thing I thought was quite special was that Alexis left us some basic groceries to start with, like coffee, milk, wine, ham and cheese.  Plus, there were some beautiful flowers on the dining table.  These touches are nice among airbnb hosts, and makes you feel really welcome.

Be prepared for lots of stairs though, which are quite narrow.  But don't worry - it's part of the charm of the house.  Definitely would recommend."
5437847;52661857;2015-10-31;20117991;Andrea;It was a very Nice stay . The réception was perfect. Moreover the house was very beautifull and well-located. It was a perfect week thanks to him

Really center.

5437847;131687532;2017-02-13;15821108;Monica;Alexis is a super polite host who communicates efficiently and is very knowledgeable about the city and the home. He was super kind and had filled the fridge with wine, beer and necessities for breakfast. House perfect for grown ups and has a central location in the Jordaan.
4091250;44335903;2015-08-25;39836496;Giulia;Coen is very kind and he gave us a lot of useful tips. The apartment is very clean, comfortable, nice and had everything that we needed. You can easily go to the centrum of Amsterdam with a tram in 15 minutes. I recommend this apartment.
4091250;57513121;2015-12-27;16865874;Scarlet;The apartment was just like the pictures. Clean and cosy. There was a small problem with mosquitos. Me and my partner got bit about 5 times, and my nose swelled up due to a bite. It was very strange as it was the end of December! But apart from that no problems. It's a good location to live, however it's a little bit far from the centre if you are only here for a short stay. The kitchen was very well equipped. Great TV with Netflix.

Das Haus ist groß und mit allem ausgestattet was man benötigt. Das Zimmer ist so wie es in der Beschreibung steht.
Nima ist sehr offen und hilfsbereit. Bei Fragen war er stets bemüht uns zu helfen.
Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen!"

4278312;98843456;2016-09-02;44876879;Alina;Nimas place is located in a beautiful and calm neighborhood with very cool and hip restaurants and bars next to the pier. The ferry goes by very often and leaves you right in the Central Station. We had a lovely stay. Thanks Nima :)
4278312;124185974;2017-01-01;17610412;Louisa;"I would NEVER stay at this place again!

We've had to MOVE OUT EARLY because it was so dirty and loud.
The bathroom was full of shaved hair and dust, the toilet was leaking, smelled like pee and one could see stains on the seat.
Apart from that it was impossible to sleep. Nima likes to listen to Techno music early in the morning and eventho is room is upstairs one can hear the baseline very clear. After I asked him to keep the noise down at least until 10 o'clock in the morning he had a 'new years after party' the next morning which startet around 6 am. Now it wasn't just the baseline that hold me back from sleep - it was also the noise made by many people ringing the bell, running up and down etc. 
At one point it became super noisy because the people also hung out and chatted infront of the room i was staying in, I got up and told Nima that it would be 7 o'clock in the morning and that we actually agreed to keep the noise down until 10. He didn't care at all and the party was going on.
Nima seemed to be quite nice in the beginning but it turned out that he is more of a reckless person. 

Its been the WORST stay I've ever had on airbnb and I can't recommend that to anyone. 

Kindest Regards,
Louisa"
4278312;130260310;2017-02-05;46564649;Thalita;Nima was very kind to us. He let me check in very late because the flight arrived almost 11pm. Helped us find a place to eat well late at night, let us use his charger  (ours is UK). The apartment is not in the center, but you walk 3 minutes, take a bus and it's downtown in less than 15 minutes. The house is clean, the bathrooms spacious and clean, the room is very cozy. Thank you so much for staying Nima!

The appartment is cozy, quite close to the center and it's very easy to get around if you rent some bikes. Overall we had a great time, I really recommend this place!

They went above and beyond in making the check in time work with our arrival time.  The house is as good as advertised and in a great neighborhood.  We really enjoyed being in a residential area which is close to the Center.  Very easy to take a Tram and get from the house to the Center quickly and easily.
1811333;42517263;2015-08-14;1233396;J;Excellent location on a quiet street, yet near museums and city center. The house is large by Dutch standards, and well equipped for our group of 6. The large garden (and good weather) made it easy to have meals outdoors.
1811333;57870100;2015-12-30;5453550;Christine & James;Carien and Jeroen's home is beautiful. It is spacious and set in a great neighborhood.  They have a great eye for artwork and interior design. The master bedroom is comfortable but there is no where to put your clothes as this is a family home filled with their things.  The preparations to their home before our arrival did not feel very through, the dishwasher was filled with dirty dishes, towels from previous guests / owners were left hanging in the bathroom, there was no toilet paper or hand soap in the bathroom.  All of these issues are small and easy fixes to make this listing an A+ in the future.
1811333;133230574;2017-02-21;65501828;Patrick;A lovely and spacious apartment in a great location, very quiet and a very good value. The kitchen is especially nice. Highly recommended

822550;29487298;2015-04-08;26628586;Mark;"Amsterdam made simple with this fabulous apartment on the canal ring.  Wonderfully set up by Daphnne & her husband, Sjoerd, as a beautiful space & home.

Conveniently located with easy walking distance to all the main parts of the city.  Surrounded by bijou shops & restaurants, as well bars.  Our hosts recommended the nearest corner bar - which was really special and a good local 'pub'.

We have been to this exciting city before, but this is our first stay using Airbnb.  Staying in such a lovely home as this gave a whole new perspective on living in the city.  Actually being like a 'local' and watching the real world go by made this an extra special stay.

Our hosts gave us the warmest welcome and left us alone to enjoy our stay.  Contact details exchanged, we were assured of support if needed.

For a very reasonable sum, our hosts even collected & returned us to the airport.  Making the holiday even more simple & relaxing."

I would absolutely stay at his place again if I ever get the chance to come back to Amsterdam. Thank you Marc!

El es muy amable, no tuvimos tampoco ningún problema para comunicarnos con el los días previos a nuestra llegada. Su departamento es muy agradable, espacioso y limpio. Si bien el hospedaje no cuenta con desayuno, Marc te ofrece su cocina y en realidad toda su casa en caso de que quieras preparar algo, lo cual es muy bueno. 
Gracias Marc por tu hospitalidad y confianza!"

 J'étais chez Marc avec mon copain. Il y a une semaine! on a passé un weekend très (URL HIDDEN) chambre étais très propre et tout était prévu en avance. le logement étais proche de tout, 15 min à pies et marc est un garçon très gentil et très calme.

Merci"
1182656;22126621;2014-10-30;20745133;Keena;"Location 
From Central train station, it is just 3 three subway lines (number 51, 53 or 54) away. Exit at the third station, called Weesperplein (all subway trains will stop there).

The apartment is just 5 minutes walk. Supermarket is just 3 minutes walk across the bridge. Convenient if you need a place nearer to city and yet peaceful. 

Amenities
The apartment is well equipped with kitchen appliances and towels are provided. Marc provided a short briefing when we arrived. We loved the toilet as it was clean and neat (you get that hotel feel.. :)) the bed was very comfortable though it gave the creaking sound. The room faces a small garden/park. A little balcony is linked from our room. Information maps and a file containing what we need to know are placed in our room for our reading. I give 10 out of 10 rating. 

Indeed a superhost. Nothing but the best."
1182656;24588799;2014-12-31;18824018;Marcel;We had three days at Marc`s apartment and everything was as described. The apartment is cozy and was very clean. It is close to the next Metro Station and The Ostpark and the great Tropenmuseum are nearby. Marc is a very nice host and answered any question we had. We would come back anytime..
1182656;26531841;2015-02-15;18554923;Chris;"Host was very welcoming and had all information together in a booklet for us to use. The apartment is perfect - modern and very clean. The room was perfect for two people plus luggage.

Directions on how to get there could not be better, no issues with finding the place. The area seems to be very safe and welcoming, no issues when walking around at night or on weekends.

Highly recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam who would like a quiet place to stay!"
11002544;66518458;2016-03-23;907286;Michael;"Fannys apartment is located in Jordaan, very central and the most beautiful area I know in Amsterdam. It is on the top floor and you get a nice view over a big and nice backyard. On the ground floor you find the living room, including the very well equipped kitchen. The upper floor consists of a bedroom and the open bathroom. You are allowed to smoke on the lower floor, that is part of why we chose this apartment. Of course you can open the windows to get rid of the smoke and some fresh air in but that also includes the cold to come inside during the colder seasons. Good thing is they even provide an electric air cleaner which works excellent, so need to freeze ;) Upstairs you also find a small balcony / outside-area, but we didn't use it due to the cold weather. The whole apartment is very comfy and furnished with nice pieces of furniture all the way through. Wifi is working very well and if you choose to stay at home after a busy day in A'dam the Smart TV has many stations to offer and comes even with Netflix ;)
Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Fanny in person but she prepared a list of things to do and restaurants close to the apartment. She even left a card of a tattoo shop on the table as I asked her for a good tattooer. Her brother in law welcomed us when we arrived and showed us around in the apartment. He was very nice and answered some question we had about the neighbourhood. I'm glad we chose Fannys apartment and we would definitely book it again!"
7551731;48026901;2015-09-22;22566042;Eric;This is a really lovely flat in an ideal area of Amsterdam. The check-in was extremely easy, and Marigai (Jennifer's friend) made us very welcome. The flat is beautiful, really well kept with everything you need, full of character, light and cheerful. It is really easy to get from the flat to the museum district which is walking distance, and you are surrounded by nice bars and great places to eat. We got 48 hour bus tickets which made travelling around simple: the flat is on a good route. Ideal: we'd definitely come back to see more of Amsterdam and stay in this friendly and tasteful flat.
2987736;19947312;2014-09-21;3960008;Mary Anne;Michael's boat is so beautifully and thoughtfully decorated. It has a large comfortable and modern bathroom, well appointed kitchen and the most scenic deck in Amsterdam. His beds and sheets are clean and comfortable . The location of the boat is smack in the middle of Amsterdam and is walking distance to all the major sights and museums. Our trip to this vibrant city was made extra special because we had this boat to come back to and enjoy the river view.
2987736;20782318;2014-10-05;21308074;Benjamin;Das boot was excellent.  If you want to stay on a beautiful houseboat in the canals of Amsterdam, then this is the one for you.  It is beautifully and tastefully decorated.  It is convenient to the city center of Amsterdam.  Michael was terrific in communication.  I highly recommend das boot to anyone wishing to visit Amsterdam.
2987736;31503518;2015-05-06;22762664;Michael;"First time using Airbnb and first time in Amsterdam, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The houseboat was beautiful - one of the best I saw anywhere in the City.  With it's high ceilings, two floors and ample outside deck, it felt roomy and comfortable.  The location is ideal - right outside the busiest section which keeps the crowds/noise manageable but extremely close by.  The views cannot be beat, especially at night when the Magere Brug (Skinny Bridge) is lit.

There are a couple spots on the boat where it's easy to bang your head so be careful.  Seems to be someone's home when not rented out (lived in feel).  

If you have the cash (not inexpensive), I would recommend staying in a houseboat, particularly this houseboat, when in Amsterdam.  Was quite the experience."
2987736;31866122;2015-05-11;19139245;Ronald;We spent four nights on the boat and most enjoyed our time spent on the terrace watching all the boats go by. Michael is a most courteous host. The interior of the boat has been redone by Michael and has everything you need. The neighborhood is very nice with stores and restaurants near by and does feel like a tourist area. If a stay on a boathouse is on your list I would recommend Michael's boat.
2987736;32369306;2015-05-17;654198;Eric;"Michael's houseboat was a highlight of our Europe trip (Cologne, Heidelberg, Bruges, Prague and Vienna)

Overall experience & views were fantastic. Houseboat is really well done, very nice modern bathroom, dining room, and downstairs living room. Kitchen is compact but complete and works well (we're foodies). As much as going out, we wanted to eat and drink wine on the large outdoor deck, watch boats & people walking across the bridge. Size works for 5 people with 3 teen+ kids sleeping in the big living room on two beds + sofa.

Location is excellent (1-2 blocks from a good deli, yolanda - sells steak, wagyu, iberico ham, etc) and a good cheese shop (Tromp). 10-15 minute walk from Marqt, a high end supermarket, Humbar, a good burger and lobster place. Close to many of the tourist attractions, especially with a bike.

Check in was good, house instructions very clear. Easy to park in front of boat, but we used a Park & Ride location (Bos) at the edge of the city. P+R is cheap and a very well-thought out system. Also space to park 5 bikes right in front. Suggest renting bikes right away vs what we did on our last two days.

Overall, 10/10. Would be our top place to stay in Amsterdam."
2987736;41187404;2015-08-05;2699492;Kyle;"Michael's houseboat is nothing short of amazing!  It is located in the best location - the upper deck is the best place in Amsterdam to sit back and take in the views. 

The boat itself is wonderful. We had friends staying in Amsterdam at the same time and they paid more for a pokey hotel room. It is spacious, well laid out and very tastefully decorated. It can't be faulted. 

Thank you Michael for a truly wonderful stay."
2987736;51196960;2015-10-18;45584976;Tara;"We loved staying on Michael's houseboat! It was beautiful, clean and well appointed as well as being in a great location!
I would highly recommend ""Das Boot"" and would would definitely come back."
2987736;72453216;2016-05-02;4317385;Adam;Michael's home was incredibly comfortable and welcoming. Located next to the Skinny Bridge, it was an ideal location that immersed us in the Amsterdam culture. Das Boot was exactly as described with sweeping views of the canal and houses, a wonderful lower deck with a wood burning stove and an amazing bathtub perfect for two people. The deck provided the perfect opportunity to sit back and relax, enjoy a glass of wine and watch the world around us. We will most definitely stay in das Boot again! Thank you Michael for sharing your wonderful home with us.

725923;4874392;2013-05-30;1627844;Robert;Bob was wonderful!!! His place is so comfortable and inviting. It's exactly how the pictures show. The location is perfect in the city. The tram from the centraal station lets off right in front of his place and all around are cafes, kitchy little stores and a market. The bathroom I would say was by far the best. These pictures don't do it justice! And for bob.... Such an awesome person. I found some of my best times in Amsterdam were at home sharing stories with him over a beer. I couldn't recommend his place any more!
725923;5013065;2013-06-07;6582677;Daniela;"It was the first time we used airbnb and we were very lucky to stay at Bob's place! The apartment and the room are very nice and clean (as seen on the photos). The location is very good to get to know Amsterdam and we got helpfull tips from Bob that made our time even better. Bob is a very kind, generous and fun host! And his cat Fritz looked out on us very well, too, always saying ""Hello"" and checking our room every day, to see if everything was okay. We can definitely recommend to stay at Bob's BNB and will be happy to come back someday =)"
725923;5749231;2013-07-15;5647131;Michaela;"Our stay at Bob's was fantastic. He's such a nice person and we had a fabulous time in Amsterdam. The apartement looks exactly as in the pictures and it's relatively close to the city centre.
Bob is very forthcoming and is very well prepared for guests. We felt very much at home. :)"
725923;7389638;2013-09-18;993528;Chloe;Thank you Bob for such an awesome stay! His stunning apartment was in a very central location that made it easy to walk into the center of the city or access the many trams nearby. He had great dining recommendations that truly made us feel like locals. Fritz the cat just added to the charm of both Bob's home and Amsterdam and we can't wait to go back!
725923;8169330;2013-10-19;7707777;Katy;Bob's flat truly give us an amazing experience in Amsterdam, everything just look like the picture, clean and stylish also convenient to every spot by walk in Amsterdam.

As we told you it was our first experience with airb'n'b and luckily we stepped in that Community with you and your great accomodation. Enjoy a lot of sunny moments on your breathtaking roof terrace this summer ! Thanks from Michael and Angelika
725923;12782361;2014-05-11;13438348;Andy;We had an awesome stay at Bob's place. The place is close to the centre, about 10-15min walking distance. The apartment was beautiful and had a magnificent bathroom and bedroom. If we decide to go back it will be this place again for sure. The place alone makes it worthwhile to go back to Amsterdam! I can fully recommend this place, including Bob, who is a great host!
725923;18650947;2014-08-30;6191671;Wallis;Very nice flat in a great location. Beautiful roof terrace, too! Bob was very friendly and offered lots of information about where to go and what to see.
725923;19260948;2014-09-09;15533764;Ruth;"Bob came down to greet us. Helped us with our bags. Helped us with making decisions about places to go and eat. We were able to walk everywhere from the apartment. 
Even though he was there most of the time and we shared a bathroom. It never felt like a problem. It felt like a private space. We had some nice talks with Bob and over all it was a wonderful experience."
725923;99534683;2016-09-05;16672983;Jannike;Bob has an amazing apartment in a great location. He and his cat are super friendly and make everything possible to make your stay as smooth as possible. I would highly recommend staying with Bob when visiting Amsterdam.

725923;126593955;2017-01-13;55490546;Humphrey;Bob is an absolutely fantastic host! We booked a very last minute trip without a real plan of where to go and Bob was so helpful and friendly! The apartment is beautiful - large, clean and spacious and situated an easy 15 minute walk from Dam Square. The room was equally decorated and very comfy - would definitely stay again!
725923;127671297;2017-01-20;36457231;Maëva;Very nice place, central it's easy to get to the city center by foot or with tram. Bob is very nice and willing to make everything easier for your stay =)
6674443;41378864;2015-08-07;32508975;Anna;La casa es correspon perfectament amb les fotos, l'habitació és correcta, però al no tenir més habitacions es dorm al sofà-llit que es còmode però al matí entra molta llum.
4061531;82558294;2016-06-28;36671309;Aubrey;"Anne's apartment was absolutely perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. The location could not have been better - as it was a 3 minute walk to the tram station. Additionally, the apartment is right across the street from a great bar, cute shops and restaurants.

The apartment itself was cute, clean, and comfortable - it had everything we could have ever needed. The wifi was very fast and consistent. Absolutely no complaints about the apartment; I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who visits Amsterdam. Thanks for a great stay, Anne!"
14070319;101272172;2016-09-12;6624335;Julian;We had a good stay at Anne's apartment. It was top located in de pijp and in close walking distance to the center (15-20 min walk). Would consider it again. We found a dead mouse the second morning of our stay, but that did not bother us much, we had the great balcony door open and it probably went through that while open. We would recommend the apartment to other travelers up to 4 persons. Thanks again for having us Anne!
13179198;108911567;2016-10-18;75873678;Will;A lovely flat in a good location. Saskia was a great host and had a list of helpful recommendations for bars and restaurants that we wouldn't have known about otherwise. Always good having a sommelier as a host!
4493007;29298354;2015-04-06;15728823;Chau Ngoc;"Alexander was a really generous and flexible host ! The prove is when we arrived with my mom and little sister to Amsterdam we got a little bit lost on the way and arrived a little bit late at night, and he waited outside his apartment the whole time.
Also he helped with navigation and stuff related to Amsterdam.
The place was fully equipped like a hotel for us.
It was located in a quiet living hood, 15 mins walking away from one of the busiest street in Amsterdam. A definite recommend."
4493007;30057056;2015-04-16;31105840;Jean Luc;it was a real pleasure to spend few days in Alexander flat. An excellent place to visit Jordan district and all the center area... a very good choice !
4493007;40252371;2015-07-29;11763149;Bill;Tucked away in Jordaan, this flat had everything we needed for our stay in Amsterdam.  Alexander was very flexible and available to help if we needed him.  I recommend staying here if you are looking for an authentic Amsterdam experience a stone's throw away from Centraal Station.
4493007;44029120;2015-08-23;40487506;Sezny;Super appartement situé dans le meilleur coin d'Amsterdam à mon avis appartement nickel alexander est de bons conseils !!

4493007;59932500;2016-01-17;5623696;Aurélie;"Nous avons passé un très bon week end chez Alexander. 
L’appartement est totalement conforme aux photos. Calme,  fonctionnel et bien situé au bord du canal.
Alexander a été accueillant et très sympa. Idéal pour un séjour seul ou en couple."
4493007;65982729;2016-03-18;44013056;Erdem;"Jordan bölgesinde turistlerden uzak, kanal kıyısında lokal insanlar gibi konaklamak harikaydı. Daire tam resimlerde görüldüğü gibi. Her türlü imkana sahip. Isınma sorunu yok, güçlü wi-fi, her türlü mutfak ekipmanı, havlu vb... Temizlik oldukça iyiydi. 

Muhit zaten güvenli...

Ev sahibi Alex ile tanışamadık ama anahtar alma/verme işlemlerini çok iyi organize etti. Her türlü sorumuza (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) üzerinden kısa sürede cevap yazdı.

Kalmayı düşünenlerin bilmesi gerekenler; banyo ufak ama kullanışlı olmasına rağmen kilolu insanlar için sıkıntı olabilir. Giriş merdiveni çok dik ve dar. bavul çıkartırken biraz zorluyor ama çıkılan merdivenin az olması şans. Bir de üst katta kalanlar sabah erken saatte evden çıkana kadar ciddi gürültü yapıyorlar...

Sonuç; Amsterdam seyahatimiz çok güzel geçti, herkese tavsiye ederim..."

New and good looking apartment."

12643640;80832264;2016-06-20;76234261;Hillary;Jolanda and her husband were great hosts! Their home is even more beautiful and spacious in person. Jolanda prepared a welcoming basket for us and compiled an email of her restaurant recommendations.  We felt at home because Yolanda did such a fantastic job at showing us around and explaining how things worked, etc. The home was more than enough space for 6 of us.  If I ever come back to Amsterdam, I hope that Jolanda's home is available!
12643640;87076000;2016-07-18;52157121;Florian;Great Appartement, well equiped, huge rooftop Terrasse, everything you need is there. Jolanda is a very nice and helpful Host and made everything to arrange a comfortable stay. Thank you very much

The house was beautiful, loved the light up bath and sink and the roof terrace was fantastic to have breakfast and dinner on, we were all so pleased with Jolanda and Wouter's place. Jolanda and Wouter were the perfect hosts and even made up a little basket of treats for our arrival. They gave us some great recommendations of where to eat and what to see during our stay in Amsterdam! The neighbourhood is the perfect location as it's just out of the centre away from the hustle and bustle but only a 5 min tram to the centre and has everything you need in terms of shops and attractions within a short walking distance. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone staying in Amsterdam, we will most definitely be staying again!!

The apartment is in a really cozy road, walking distance to the city centre, but nicely tucked away from busy tourist areas. There are various amenities on the main road nearby, a nice cafe, a bakery, and other shops.

The bedroom and living room were really large, and extremely comfortable. Large windows on both sides made the inside beautifully bright.
Note though that the bathroom is extremely small.

The apartment made a great base for our walks into the city.

Denis shares his whole home with his guests - it’s truely a beautiful place to be.

The place is in the middle of Amsterdam - a quite silent (except the party boats on the amstel) place on the water - we will miss the sway of the waves…
 
He was always helpful with the planning and gave answers to all questions, as well were his friends, who stayed in touch during our stay.

Thanks a lot for the hospitality und sharing this beautiful home!! We had a wonderful week and missed nothing."

Right around the corner there are a big market, cafés and shops. The place was not far from the city centre, we decided to walk and it took us 20 minutes. The communication with the hosts was easy and we really had a great time in Amsterdam! Thank you Murat and Ela, we hope to see you soon!
1583266;12284493;2014-04-28;7817900;Giulia;Murat and Ela have been extremely kind and friendly. They gave us suggestions on where to go in Amsterdaam and made us feel like home.

Even Murat was not at home his friend kindly shows me the appartments and give some instructions and suggestions what to do in Amsterdam. There was a little but tasty breakfast waiting for me. The cat is also great!
The price might be little less but I has booked the room just couple of days before coming, so it was a good offer still.

Our time in Amsterdam was made so much better due to location and comfort of their home. Nice, quiet and safe neighbourhood, only a 10 minute tram ride to everything Amsterdam or you could walk like us. The market around their apartment is also worth a visit for all who would like to get a more local feel."

Ela and Murat are great host. They really want you to feel at home,  easy to communicate with beforehand, very flexible with checking-in, and very warm, nice easy-going people. The neighborhood is very central and nice. The room is great. It's spacious, nicely decorated and the bed is really good. I had a tough time getting out of bed in the morning :)

13049056;121459134;2016-12-17;30889391;Asif;"Our Experience was not that good at this AirBNB - but read if you are looking to stay here. We arranged with our host Mariah for our 6pm arrival time, which then got changed to 7pm by the host but she mentioned her husband will be there. No one was there to let us in for 40 minutes (good thing we had our car to wait in). Room advertised with free parking, but it's only free between 9pm to 9am. All other times it's a paid parking on a side street @ 1.40/hour from the house. The only free 24hr parking was more than 11 minutes walk or about 1 KM away from the house. Not the safest area too. Our Room location was on the 4th floor (spiral stair case). Hard work even for fit person carrying luggage up. would have preferred if these things were mentioned on the advert. 
I was told to bring our own towels, but I would suggest to take your home slippers too as we did. I am okay to bring these things as i was travelling in my car but not ideal for people travelling light. 
As for the room, it was unfinished, decorative wood / skirting board staked in the corner, gaps in the dry/stud wall. There were not even complementary water in the room, however had a spread of confectionery/soft drinks that was laid out for purchase in the room.  
I understand about cleaning after yourself and keeping noise down in a shared house/apartment (its just normal courtesy and respect for the homeowners) but the way it is mentioned both on their rule sheets taped in the room and in the toilet is a bit too much. And on top of that condition of toilet/shower room was disgusting - Again unfinished work, dirty and hair every where. We cleaned that too of course when we cleaned up after ourselves. 
We never saw the host (Mariah) but she kept messaging us about checkout time and even though we had the same conversation with her husband. So in effect, repeating information/instructions were given to us regarding room and checkout procedure.. I personally think this place is okay for someone not travelling by car and would give this AirBNB a 2 stars out of 5 service."
4646450;39737027;2015-07-26;5201470;Terry;Aya's place was great. The place was beautiful and exactly as shown in the photos. It is decorated very tastefully and is located in a good area that is walking distance from most things to do in Amsterdam. Aya was very kind and helpful - her guide to the area and city was thoughtful and detailed.
4646450;52818405;2015-11-02;11244573;Shannon;Excellent apartment in a wonderful neighborhood.  The apartment is beautifully decorated and very spacious.  We appreciated all of the amenities, as well as neighborhood recommendations that were provided (we LOVED De Foodhallen!).   Aya was very accommodating with our check in/out times, and even provided a welcome bottle of wine.  It was the perfect end to our vacation, and I would love to stay here again.
13653852;88741928;2016-07-25;50978405;Arnaud;We enjoyed our staying in the appartment. We had several people as contact, everybody was nice. the check out is a little bit early and it was not possible to let our luggages.
13653852;90091545;2016-07-31;83572885;Brian;"The apartment was really nice and situated in a cool neighborhood! The location is very good and only a short walk to the city center. 
Would highly recommend staying here!"
13653852;129903381;2017-02-03;2689840;Genna;"We really enjoyed our stay at Gijs' apartment. It's a beautiful and comfortable space and excellent location.
We were welcomed by a woman who provides Airbnb guest services for the host, so we never actually met Gijs, but she was welcoming and helpful and Gijs kept in touch by email to ensure smooth check in.
We found a lovely bakery and a big supermarket around the corner - and Amstel Bikes to rent bicycles for our stay (Avoid the closer one on the same street as the apartment).
Would definitely stay here again or recommend."

Thank you Zidan!"
996112;24846032;2015-01-03;17208614;Manuel;Great flat on two floors with enough space for four people. Big living room and great kitchen. Unfortunately we couldn't use the garden due to cold weather in December. Ellen was a very friendly host. The location is very well. Walking distance to the city center and the main shopping street is just one corner away.
761411;4020696;2013-04-03;576189;Akos;"The Central Station is within a 20-25 mins bus ride, the flat is amazing, especially the bath. Clean, relaxed, the neighborhood is full of trees and of course a canal beside the house. We did spot some parrots on the trees and bunnies around which says everything about the location.
We got some chocolate as welcome gifts and the overall feeling was that you are in a 4 star hotel with everything you could wish for. We are sitting here now for some 5 minutes but cannot think of anything that should make you a little bit concerned. So it is PERFECT."
761411;4235114;2013-04-21;5511159;Ilaria;"Kiong is a very nice person, he helped us very much during our jorney and it has been very helpful and kind.
The house is located in a very nice and quiet residential area a little bit far from the Central station of Amsterdam (you take about 15-20 minutes by bus, but is very easy to reach).The apartment is very clean and pretty with a big bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Also the duble badroom is very big and Xiong left us a lot of space for our clothes in his wardrobe.
Ps. for girls, bring an hair dryer with you if you think you will probably need it because Xiong hasn't it."
761411;8478040;2013-11-02;7337456;Julia;"I stayed at Xiongs apartment for two months and I enjoyed it a lot. Xiong is very nice, he made every effort to make my stay pleasant and he showed me a great deal of trust (he was away quite often). He was especially easy about check in and check out. 'Clean, quiet, safe' is definitely the right description for the place.
My best compliments!
(Yes, it takes you 20 / 25 minutes by bus to get to Central Station, but you don't have to change buses or anything - very easy)"
761411;12687450;2014-05-08;13101660;Daiying;房东是很好的人,聊天当中发现大家是老乡!这无疑是一个很大的惊喜,房间非常干净舒适,小区外面的环境也很好,还有野生的兔子~有问题的地方,房东也会热情帮忙!总的来说,很棒~
761411;14881009;2014-06-28;2814010;Nick;enjoyed my 4 night stay. the house was clean and my room was comfy. Xiong wasn't around but he checked up on me before, during and after the trip. I arrived in Amsterdam quite late but Xiong made arrangements to see me through. would be great if we met, but maybe next time as i'm sure to visit Amsterdam again. again, thanks Xiong and Reina!
761411;14962967;2014-06-30;14927547;Sergey;"Good reference is the last thing that Xiong's place needs, you can clearly see that from all the rightfully deserved positive feedback on his page. However I would feel wrong if I wouldn't say that being my first airbnb experience, Xiong's apartment set a really high bar for all my future airbnb-appointed accommodations.

The room on the picture IRL is actually even better than it looks: really spacious and has a nice view from the window. You also shouldn't be frightened by location, bus trip to the central railway station (which is basically the center of the city) takes just 15-20 minutes.

Absolutely recommended to everyone who wishes to enjoy his stay in Amsterdam and have a nice and clean accommodation."
761411;19539774;2014-09-14;13240260;Ton;Xiong's apartment is amazing! It's very warm and clean and it's very convenient to the central station!
761411;22814945;2014-11-15;9442538;Antonina;"Xiong is a wonderful host who made the the experience stress free and easy. He was very helpful with advice on what to see during my very short stay, had maps and directions ready, and was friendly and warm. 

The room and the apartment are very clean and convenient. 

The apartment is a very easy 15min bus ride away from the central station."
761411;27614465;2015-03-08;24559348;Julie;Xiong and his place were perfect for my stay in Amsterdam--truly a clean and quiet retreat. The apartment is lovely, easy to find, and just a short bus ride from all the central sites (the bus runs often and at all hours). I stayed in the smaller room which had a comfy single bed, small desk, room for my belongings, and just enough space for my yoga mat. Xiong was very welcoming, flexible with my check-in time, and ready to offer a cup of tea in the morning and evening.
761411;35127846;2015-06-15;8117022;Jesica;"We had lovely stay at Xiong's apartment. 
We felt like at home. It is comfortable, tidy and clean. 
A bit far from the centre but perfectly fine to commute at any time and after a busy day it's great to have some quiet place to stay. 
Make sure you arrange with Reina (the neighbour)  to open the door for you. 
she was also lovely. Flat doesn't have a hairdryer so she let us borrow hers."
761411;43043267;2015-08-17;14663740;Juraj;"Unfortunately I haven´t been able to meet Mr.Zheng personally but his friend Reina handled me keys and provided with a plenty of informations.She´s a very kind and helpful Lady.
 Flat is conveniently located up to 20 minutes journey by bus to Central station in leafy&quiet area.I had a great stay there.
 Thank you,Xiong.

939698;7341190;2013-09-16;8228575;Elaine;Wow, what can I say, the houseboat was amazing, we were delighted with our choice of accommodation, it was spotlessly clean, very comfortable, warm and cosy.  Our hosts were waiting for us, even though we were delayed over four hours.  We highly recommend this houseboat, if we were to return to Amsterdam we would love to stay on the houseboat again, perhaps spending more time on it.
939698;29378685;2015-04-07;2711360;Louise;We had a great time on the houseboat. Marijke, her partner, and their children were great hosts. The boat was very spacious and really well equipped, my children particularly appreciated the toys and the swing on the deck. There are really steep steps on the boat and must walk along side of boat to board, children handled these with ease. Really nice quiet area with good shops nearby and easy transport links. Would very much recommend for a family trip to Amsterdam.
939698;30980816;2015-04-30;1581244;Jean-Claude;"Très bien accueillis, avec une aide pour arriver jusqu'à la péniche (pas facile le jour du Kingsday) ; la Péniche est très bien équipée, au décor très design, vaste, confortable (sol chauffant très apprécié dans la salle de bain), 
La literie très bonne et l'environnement est particulièrement calme ; on apprécie le bercement imperceptible du bateau.
Le piano, sympa aussi, pour se faire un petit concert famille le soir....
Le quartier est très sympa, l'idéal est de louer des vélos pour se déplacer. 2 lignes de bus et un Tramway à 5/10mn pour aller l'importe où dans le centre. Supermarché à 10mn à pieds."
939698;58303566;2016-01-02;44729060;Nikolas;"Wir hatten einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam über Silvester!
Das Boot ist sehr gut angebunden, sowohl von der Autobahn als auch mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln! 
Die Vermieter haben wir zwar nicht persönlich kennengelernt, die Schlüsselübergabe wurde aber organisiert und lief reibungslos. Für Fragen während des Aufenthalts stand der Vermieter immer zu Verfügung. Die Ausstattung des Boots lässt keine Wünsche offen."
4650761;33903086;2015-06-02;21930866;Grahame;"Danny made us feel very welcome, the beers in the fridge where a nice touch and very much appreciated.  The boathouse is just like the photos, clean and bright with amazing views on the Amstel river. It was a pleasure to sit back, relax, and watch the boats go by.  

The location is perfect too, close to the Metro, supermarket, bars and restaurants.   We would definitely like to stay at the houseboat again, great holiday."
4650761;35621350;2015-06-20;10460196;Lisandro;Danny was amazing! Whenever I needed anything he was on top of things. His place was close to everything plus it was so easy to get around I would highly recommend his place to anyone in Amsterdam who wants to stay on the water!! Thanks again
4650761;38390088;2015-07-15;33481744;Brigitte & Noël;"Danny's House boat is a very nice place to stay, very clean and perfectly equiped. It was quite confortable for 5 persons and so pleasant to have breakfast and dinner on the desk on the Amstel River watching boats go by ... in spite of 2 days rain !! 
Danny is a caring and helpful host each time we need something. Thank you so much Danny !
The location is perfect, very quiet and easy to reach downtown walking or with subway. Very close to bike hire too.
The typical place to be in Amsterdam !"
4650761;41066192;2015-08-04;2332528;Anneke;Great location, only 20mins walk to city centre. Lovely waterside terrace with great views. Good WiFi. We'd definitely stay here again!
4650761;43000134;2015-08-16;39636089;Nicholas;This house was one of the highlights of our European trip. It is such a cool place on the Amstel river with a floating deck in the back. However, if you're afraid of spiders, keep in mind that we ran into a lot of them inside. That being said, the host was wonderful, informative and lives right next door. There are two nice bedrooms and a large spacious living room with a sofa bed. I would highly recommend staying at this place.
4650761;50637027;2015-10-13;2589434;Paola;Danny is a very nice person. He welcomed us personally and with two bottles of wine even though the flight was late (moreover one of us arrived before and he welcomed her personally while she was waiting for us). He lives near the houseboat, so for everything he is always available,  personally or on the phone as you prefer.  The houseboat is wonderful, very big, confortable and clean. The terrace is really great, perfect for appreciating the beautiful wiew of the city while making an apero . We will definitely came back! See you soon Danny! A warm greeting from all of us!
4650761;51426925;2015-10-20;35792427;Diego;Great place! The house has evrething, and Danny is very nice. I recommend this place you will enjoy amsterdam. If you are not hurry you woldnt need the metro. We will come back.
4650761;53992433;2015-11-15;17376209;Richard;"Danny vart en utmärkt värd. Han mötte upp oss vid ankomst med nycklar och champagne. Husbåten var i fantastiskt skick och bland dom bekvämare boenden jag haft i Amsterdam. Danny tog oss på en rundtur efter att vi blev inkvarterade i husbåten. Metron ligger 3 min från boendet och tar ca 7min till centralen. Rekommenderar starkt detta boende och Danny som värd. 

Jag kommer definitivt boka detta boende igen!"
606871;68980492;2016-04-08;28534277;Eva;Awesome host and super nice and cozy houseboat. Diewert and his family were extremely friendly and welcoming. As our flight arrived late at night, Diewert had provided us with very clear details on how to access to the houseboat before our arrival so that the whole check-in was very smooth. The local bikes rental made our stay extra convenient. The interior was in great set-up and all the amenities were of high quality. There were a thick folder and a board full of useful museum and sightseeing information and restaurant recommendations which were apparently a great effort of the host. It was definitely a short but sweet stay for us and we enjoyed it so much.
606871;69200580;2016-04-10;16959534;Alexandra;"The houseboat is a nice place. Perfect to stay in Amsterdam for a few days! It looked like in the pictures and was clean. We enjoyed our stay very much!
The neighborhood was nice and calm, not much happening but Diewert's place is really close from the center by walk.
I really recommend this apartment!"
606871;69879775;2016-04-14;56220826;Kayla;Our room was great and in a quite part of town. It was very clean and cozy. I loved that they had bikes that we were able to rent to ride around the city .

606871;83623465;2016-07-03;47615557;Jenny;We loved everything about our stay. Diewert was so friendly and helpful, from giving us ideas on places to see and great places to eat. He even arranged transport for us to go to the airport. Our accommodation  was spotlessly clean and drinks and snacks were available in the fridge. We would not hesitant to recommend this place to anyone.
606871;84341629;2016-07-06;43253064;Sami;The houseboat was a perfect size for our short time in Amsterdam. We loved the location, it was a nice quiet neighborhood and not too far walking distance from the things we wanted to see.  The hosts were very nice and even made a reservation for our first dinner in town. The patio was very nice to sit outside with the flowers.
606871;94142082;2016-08-14;8580053;Jenny;Had a great time in Amsterdam. Loved this little houseboat. Could walk everywhere. The place was very clean and we were made very welcome. Would highly recommend

We could easily reach the city center with a nice walk and in the neighborhood are a lot of bars and restaurants. Cyril was a very attentive host - even though we could not meet him in person, he arranged everything so we had a very pleasent stay. If I would visit Amsterdam another time, I would definitely want stay at his flat again.

5628141;28281699;2015-03-21;11290504;Nicole;"Beautiful apartment in a fantastic location and neighbourhood.  The apartment is on the third floor, with no lift and stairs are somewhat narrow, so I wouldn't pack too heavy! Albert Cuyp Market is the next street over and you can walk into city center everyday/multiple times a day no problem.  We never had the opportunity to meet Kim but she was available through email, and had arranged another contact to greet us and help us when needed throughout our stay.  As we were the first to stay in her home there were a few kinks to be ironed out but Kim made every effort to help fix them from afar!
All in all, would definitely recommend this apartment.  Thank you for the hospitality, Kim."
8781478;74230722;2016-05-14;13999235;Michael;Zyad is a very nice and accommodating person. He took off of work early to make sure I could get to my room after a long day of travel, and helped get me settled into Amsterdam with advice about nearby eateries.

1010056;5886974;2013-07-21;6109662;Mustafa;Amazing beautiful place. Pictures do not do it justice. Very central. And rob was a sweetheart, had drinks with him during my arrival, at which time he told me where I should go and do. Wonderful experience. Two huge thumbs up!
1010056;7691405;2013-09-30;7102243;Gabriella;My boyfriend and I have been to Amsterdam a few times but this was BY FAR our best trip.... Rob's apartment is amazing, in a great location and extremely clean and comfortable- it has everything you could need and even came with a complimentary bottle of wine. We felt right at home! Unfortunately Rob was unable to greet us as he was abroad, but he kept in touch with us throughout the trip to make sure everything was OK. His lovely partner met us and showed us around- he made us feel very welcome and even went out of his way to find us when we got a little bit lost on arrival! LOL. The bed is HUGE (we had the best nights' sleep!) and the sofa was very cozy. We also cooked a few meals- the kitchen has so many cooking utensils etc and a mini supermarket is a few steps away- ideal if you enjoy a bit of cooking or need anything urgently. The roof top terrace is beautiful and has amazing views of the canal- it is perfect for chilling out after a busy day (it would be even more fantastic when the weather is hot to have BBQ's up there!) The location is perfect and extremely close to the souvenir shops, restaurants, coffee shops, pubs etc (approx 15 min walk). Truly a fabulous place to stay- so much so- we are already talking about coming back! Thanks again to Rob for letting us use your wonderful apartment and for being flexible with check in/check out times- I had a great Birthday trip!!! We will be back! Gabby & Navi xxx
1010056;8943337;2013-11-27;8208245;Devin;"Rob was a lovely host and his place is fantastic! His apartment is on the 
quieter side of town which was perfect for us, and also within walking 
distance from places of interest. We could not have wished for a better 
place to stay during our time in Amsterdam - we have nothing but great 
things to say about Rob and our stay!"
1010056;9993833;2014-01-24;5596708;Zara;My boyfriend and I arrived in Amsterdam at around  9 In the evening.Having previously looked at the route on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps we decided to walk to the apartment and found it with no bother at all . Rob's neighbour Christian welcomed us to the apartment and showed us everything we needed to know and also gave us recommendations for food and drink in the immediate area. The pictures do not do the apartment justice ! The views are just spectacular . The downstairs area was very comfortable and the couch was so comfy we found ourselves trying to keep our eyes open whilst lounging on it . The kitchen is fabulous with every utensil you would need so no need to worry about cooking anything . The bed was so cozy and we found it really difficult to get up in the morning due to that . The area is very safe which is very reassuring when coming back to the apartment later on in the evening. Having visited the city twice previously we could not imagine staying in any other apartment or hotel after the experience we had and would recommend it to everyone and anyone if your looking for an authentic , amazing , enjoyable experience in the city. One thing I would recommend is bringing a pair of slippers or house shoes as Rob prefers no shoes worn in the apartment as anyone who lives in an apartment can relate to that noisy neighbour upstairs who stomps about in shoes. The spiral staircase is made of iron and has little raises which can be quite uncomfortable barefoot so slippers will be useful . Other than that there is nothing else we could recommend other than booking this apartment straight away if you are planning a stay in Amsterdam.We will definitely be back !  P.S we had the pleasure of meeting Rob before we left the apartment and he is so friendly, fun and has great stories to tell about his travels . Thanks Rob and we will see you soon !
1010056;11175126;2014-03-24;4050226;Angie;"We expected Rob to be an awesome host from the raving reviews we read but we were still wonderfully surprised by his absolute generosity, warmth and hospitality. 

Rob's place is centrally located but quiet and with a real neighborhood feel, the view from those oversized windows was stunning, lots of public transportation even though we walked everywhere within 15-20 min, and there is a row of little cute restaurants down the street which we enjoyed exploring. 

Thank you again Rob, I can't wait to be back!"

From The beginning to the end he was brilliant communicating with us each step of the way and even emailed us whilst he was away in Paris to check everything was going well. 
Walmir, Rob's friend was waiting on our arrival to check in and he was just as pleasant. 
The apartment and roof terrace were stunning, clean and with fantastic views in a lovely area close to but quieter than the busy centre. 
We would have no doubts in returning and will recommend to friends and family."
1010056;66177507;2016-03-20;6607940;Mohammad;"My 5-night stay at Rob's gorgeous place was by far the best experience I had in Amsterdam (It's my 3rd time visiting Amsterdam, and also 3rd time renting through  AirBnB). The view of the canal from the living room (lower level) and the bedroom (upper level) was mesmerizing. The décor of the apartment is exquisite. The location is in a quite neighborhood. There is a grocery store 1 minute away walking, and the zoo is less than 10 minutes  away walking. 

As for the host Rob, he is one of the kindest hosts you will find on AirBnB. Had my best check-in experience with Rob. He was very friendly and had everything typed up into neat lists for any questions or issues you might have (instructions, recommendations for eating, and maps).

Overall, it was a 5-star experience staying at Rob's.

Regards,
Mo"
1010056;102259213;2016-09-17;1846252;Nancy;Rob is an exceptional host. He's become a friend. We've stayed at his apartment in the past so this was a return visit. Rob had everything prepared beautifully for us including a delicious bottle of wine. His apartment had everything we needed, a lift, complete kitchen, a most comfortable bed from which one can watch the canal, a washer and dryer, a big desk upstairs for spreading out clothing or personal items and a comfortable lounge area full of Rob's treasures with gorgeous views of the canals. Rob's neighbourhood is a great part of Amsterdam, close to everything one might need and public transport. Rob provides ideas for local restaurants and highlights of the neighbourhood. The bar downstairs on the canal was a regular haunt of ours during those hot summer evenings. We'd sit by the canal and have a cold beer in this beautiful place. Rob thanks for everything.

5733280;32246333;2015-05-16;29925844;Yo;"Nous avons passé un agréable we... Inge est une personne agréable et la chambre est conforme à la photo. 
La maison est très bien située, en plein coeur de la ville. Il faut tout de même noter que l'électricité reste rustique et qu'il nous est arrêté de ne pas avoir d'eau chaude. 
Enfin, cela ne nous a pas dérangé car nous avons trouvé cela charmant mais il semble nécessaire de préciser que la chambre se trouve juste à côté d'une église qui sonne très souvent.
Nous recommandons cet endroit."
5733280;33674759;2015-05-31;16824510;Gemma;"We had a great time at Inge's house, she was super welcoming and helpful. 

The room was great, and really clean. Amazing location also!

Inge also let us leave our bags at the house after we checked out as we had a late flight, which was really kind.

Recommended!"
5733280;34222031;2015-06-06;32863220;Manon;L'appartement est idéalement placé : centre de la ville dans un quartier calme et sécurisé . Inge, très discrète, a su nous accueillir très gentillement et nous est même venu en aide dans certains moment. La chambre est très spacieuse. Petit bémol : manque de lumière , assez gênant le soir. je recommande !!
5733280;34652850;2015-06-10;32285553;Jill;"This is a very comfortable room in an awesome location. Amsterdam is expensive generally, but this place felt like it was worth it. In addition to a large, very comfortable bed, there is a nice sitting area, coffee corner, wardrobe and bathroom with shower/tub. The room has a lot of ""Amsterdam character"" - it's right up under the eaves, so the room slopes dramatically and there are views from the windows. There's a window at the foot of the bathtub and the shower is right under the roof! We left our bags at the airport (Schipol airport has excellent, reasonably-priced lockers) so the stairs didn't bother us. If you had backpacks, the steepness of the stairs would be an exciting part of your Amsterdam experience. If you had heavy suitcases, it'd be pretty hard. 
Inge and her husband were very welcoming and helpful to us. Thank-you for a wonderful stay!"
5733280;45101803;2015-08-31;38332488;Clare;We were greeted by Inge's daughter when we arrived and she was so lovely and helpful, showing us to our room, talking us through the facilities and answering our questions. It is in jordaan which i hadn't realised was quite so cool! Really nearby was Paradox, Sound Garden, canal bike rental, Anne Frank House, and ALBERT HEIJNE (supermarket). The description is spot on, and the room is exactly as we imagined.
5733280;51044572;2015-10-17;9250426;Wassim;Inge was very nice and friendly. Although I didn't get the chance to stay for too long at her home, and I went there late and just slept for one night, but she was extremely helpful and offered me to keep my luggage for free even one day after I checked out. The home style and the coffee station are the things that I liked the most about the place. Inge's home was very clean and organized and the location is in the center of the city. I strongly recommend staying at Inge's.
5733280;57647938;2015-12-28;324524;Ka;The apartment was very clean and cost. The location was fantastic, just few minutes away from Anne Frank house and the bus stop. There were several breakfast places open even on Christmas! The house was very quiet and the only noise was the westerkerk church chiming. Only inconvenience was the toilet was on the lower floor.
5733280;115925435;2016-11-27;71254051;Elena;"Room exactly as shown in the photos, quiet but very central street, 5 minute walk from the center of Amsterdam; it's near Anna Frank's house and museum. The building is really ancient, so it's perfect if you want to live as a real native, but has almost all commodities needed. Inge was really welcoming and gave us all the instructions on how to get to the airbnb and how to rent bicycles etc. An amazing experience you certainly can't miss if you are going to Amsterdam any time soon!"
5733280;125488867;2017-01-06;5933817;Olivia;"Had a great stay at Inge's. Everything that other guests have said in praise is spot on. 

Inge is very responsive and sent great instructions for getting to the house easily. The room is more spacious than I expected, with high ceilings and a comfy couch to lounge on. The private bathroom was really great (although do note that the toilet is down one quick flight of stairs) and the coffee/tea cart was perfect in the morning. We also found the bed extremely comfortable. 

This is the top floor of a home right off one of the main canals. Everyone has said it, but do expect a few flights of very steep stairs. Still so cool to be able to stay in one of the actual homes in Amsterdam, so we didn't mind at all. Perfect location within walking distance to everything and just three blocks from a tram stop. The Anne Frank Haus is just across the canal. 

The only thing worth noting for future travelers is that the shower is quite small. We didn't have any issues with it, but we're not tall. 

Excellent value, amazing location, spacious and comfortable. What more could you possibly need?"

Lontano dal centro, ma con 20 - 30 min di passeggiata a piedi già si arrivava in piazza Dam; poche volte abbiamo usato i mezzi per tornare a casa! Brava Marina e grazie per la tua disponibilità che forse abbiamo poco usato! :)"
7552387;49782094;2015-10-06;41157525;Kamil;We had a great stay at this apartment. It's very well located close to the Dam and supermarkets, cafes and everything that you will need. Very well equipped and Marina has showed us everything we need to know about the area and how to travel around the city. Would definitely recommend! Thank you for the great stay Marina.

The apartment was as described and very clean an tidy, it was in a very good location right next to a tram stop for heading into the centre. Overall a great experience would stay again :)
965629;4722766;2013-05-21;6420434;Marcia;I was traveling alone and enjoyed the privacy of staying in Bernadette's caravan.  It was clean and well-prepared for my arrival. I appreciated that she was very accommodating and flexible when my arrival was delayed due to traffic. Her information about the local area was helpful and I discovered even more delightful close-by sights and shops than she had mentioned -- including a working windmill with museum at the end of the street.  I liked that there was free parking, both at her home and near to the tram line, so I could hop on the tram and enjoy downtown without any hassles. And the breakfast every morning was a great send-off. Good value for money.
965629;4974018;2013-06-04;2359291;Emmerich;Great stay! Our hosts were super friendly and helpful. Saw to our needs. Waited late  till we arrived as we'd lost oyr way. A wonderful weekend. Thanks to both of you.
965629;5615836;2013-07-08;3029018;Ray;We had a fun time staying here. I enjoyed watching the chickens every morning. We enjoyed the breakfast and the recommendations to the beach and the river. Thank you for great hospitality you should us!
965629;6971744;2013-09-01;8207864;ZiCheng;I had the lovely time at Bernadette's place. This part of Amsterdam was very charming.

965629;7442052;2013-09-20;7557543;Carolyn;We had a great stay with Bernadette. She was a wonderful host, and we felt very comfortable there. It is slightly further out of town, but it is an easy half hour bus or tram trip into the centre of Amsterdam, so it just depends what you are looking for location-wise. But for a very pleasant stay in a quiet neighbourhood with a very different accommodation experience, I would recommend it here.
965629;8785668;2013-11-18;508680;Sofie&Kim;It was nice to stay in this cosy, but small caravan. We had a lovely time in Amsterdam. The only thing - certainly in winter time- the toilet / shower are on the boat, so you need to get out in the cold. But the nice breakfast in the morning makes up for that.
965629;14975295;2014-06-30;15946619;Franziska-Maria;"It was a very nice weekend. Bernadette and her husband were absolut charmant & helpful. We slept very well in this nice caravan, which was very clean & comfortable.
Thank you very much, Bernadette & Albert - If we can, we'll be back :) and this time without having a cold ;) 

Franziska & daughter"

We had yummy breakfast and one night we watched a worldcup game together on their houseboat! Was fun! If you wanna go to Amsterdam you just need to walk 15min to the next train station and take the tram for another 15 min to the citycenter.

We had a wonderful weekend! Thanks for everything!! Marc & Ellen"
965629;15679200;2014-07-14;13900004;Nina;Natalie and me were staying over the weekend. We had a really pleasant stay. Bernadette was not here, but Albert took his time to give us tips and to help us with everything.

965629;48895322;2015-09-29;17580899;Adam & Izelle;"Staying with Bernadette was such a treat and a great experience. Her home is just a stroll away from the tram 2 stop from/to Amsterdam Central. It's in a charming part of town where you can take a walk to the beach or nearby windmill. Her Airbnb is truly one of a kind. You'll witness just how amazing of an artist she is through the beautifully and creatively curated items in the living spaces. And if you're lucky, you might meet her equally gifted husband, Albert, a furniture maker. As for our accommodations, we slept in a cute caravan with a comfy bed. We also had a second ""living room"" which was lovingly prepared each morning with a delicious breakfast. Thank you Bernadette and family for a wonderful, unforgettable stay!"
965629;49651309;2015-10-05;43393277;Ee Shian;Bernadette and daugther, Lucie were excellent. Warm and friendly hospitality with more blankets as promised and nice simple breakfast!!! we even get a basket of warm bread with hard boiled egg. Good to have it in a cold morning.

965629;68537849;2016-04-05;63867542;Silvia;"The Bern & Breakfast is fantastic! The caravan is so cool, little but so nice; also the little house with the living room and the bathroom is perfect to have a little break after a day around the city. The neighborhood is very nice and the walk, linking the last stop of the metro number 2 with the caravn, is surrounded by nature and it doesn't steal so much time! I would recommend it to all people who love nature and prefer a bit of peace after spending the day in centre of Amsterdam. Bernadette and Albert were very kind and helpful, if you need something you just have to ask them!
Maybe a day we will see each other, maybe in Verona! Thanks for everything, 
Silvia and Alessio."
965629;71662220;2016-04-27;56215323;Anaïs;Nous sommes tombés sous le charme de cet endroit paisible et mignon en bordure d'Amsterdam. Situé au calme et laissant tout le loisir de se promener à pieds ou à vélo dans la nature environnante, ce lieu n'en est pas moins dépourvu du romantisme et de l'âme que nous avons pu découvrir à Amsterdam. Il est desservi par les transports en communs pour se rendre en centre-ville  et est situé non loin de l'aéroport. Bernadette et son mari sont adorables et pleins attentions, la caravane et son annexe offrent une totale autonomie. Merveilleux séjour :)
965629;80906394;2016-06-20;73330485;Khac Phuc Hung;We were warmly welcomed. I felt like at home. The surrounding of the caravan is so peaceful and calm. The atmosphere is very cozy inside the livingroom. The caravan is lovely and well decorated. Moreover, I love the breakfast because we eat the way we eat in France (like at home) but we have local products which are really taste. Last but not least, it's quite easy to go from the city to the caravan, direct from tram line 2 and walk for 10 minutes. Perfect.
965629;83812768;2016-07-04;77743366;Stephan;Bernadette & Albert are very relaxed and outstanding hosts. Both are very helpful and very likeable. We also liked the vintage style and many other minor details of the accomodation.

Thank you very much Bernadette & Albert for your kind hospitality, we felt as comfortably as at home. Many Greetings from Valentina & Stephan :-)

The house is beautiful, cosy bedroom and very modern barthroom, there was room enough for all our things.
The breakfast was included and so delicious with fresh products, really amazing to start the day !
Nanda and Paul are so friendly, they really care about their guests and do their best to make us have the best time as possible. Indeed, we had a wonderful weekend staying with them, and we'd recommand to anyone to choose this accomodation, you won't regret it !"

We especially enjoyed our conversations with our hosts and would stay there again next time we visit Amsterdam. Thank you for a great visit.
9403324;56514601;2015-12-14;10168133;Saskia;Nanda and her husband were absolutely lovely hosts! They made us feel very much at home in their beautiful house. Coming back to the charming place from the vivid city was so very relaxing ... They offered us coffee and tea at any time and made us feel like part of the house. The breakfast she offered was amazing, too! They both prepare everything with love, you can feel that! Moreover she always took time for a little chat and helped us with nice ideas about what to do & see in Amsterdam. Last but not least their sweet dog made our stay just perfect, I would recommend a stay at Nanda's at any time - I hope to come back soon!

North Amsterdam is also a great location. Esther's house is a 7 minute bus ride or 20 min walk and ferry trip to Central Station, so it's really close to the centre of town without all the busyness or tourists. It's near to two big supermarkets, small shops, a bakery and loads of great bars and restaurants. The EYE cinema/ film museum is also really nearby, and the Noord Museum is only a 2 minute walk down the street! You can also take a really nice, long walk up this very old street and get to Dogel Dam, which is a great villagey area.

I couldn't recommend Esther's house highly enough, and Esther herself is a brilliant host who made us feel really welcome and was extremely helpful during out stay!"

The neighborhood is very quiet and there is no car circulation, you can rest quietly at night. The zone is very beautiful, it is close to a canal, you can see it from the dining room. From the main bedroom you can see a garden, as well as from the kitchen. There is a big supermarket close to the apartment (6-7 min walking) where you can buy everything you need, and it has a wide schedule (even sundays, in august at least). The owner is very kind and helpful. In addition she lent us their bikes, we enjoyed Amsterdam by bike as a real Amsterdamer. I definitively recommend it for families, we stayed two adults and two children comfortably.

Studio très fonctionnel, situé dans une rue calme, avec au coin de la rue le métro (dont vous n'aurez pas besoin car tout est à côté) et un supermarché.
Hein a été d'une aide précieuse. Carte à l'appui, il m'a indiqué tous les itinéraires à faire à Amsterdam. J'ai passé un merveilleux week-end grâce à lui !"
7474662;45456945;2015-09-03;40666408;Elliott;"Had an amazing time in Amsterdam and couldnt have asked for a more perfect place to stay. Hein made us feel more than welcome and he would take the time to talk us through what to do/see during our trip from a locals point of view, rather than another tour-guide based trip. 
The apartment had everything you could need for a short stay and although the location isn't directly in the centre of Amsterdam, it is a short walk that allows visitors to really see what Amsterdam is all about. 
I will definately be coming back and Hein will be my first option when looking for a place to stay.

Thank you! :)"
7474662;46612096;2015-09-12;33345292;Manosha;Hein was lovely and gave us lots of ideas that aren't in guidebooks. Great location, about a 15min walk into the centre and less than a min to metro. The flat was clean and cosy and is ideal for a short stay.
7474662;60560590;2016-01-25;44407994;Pauline;"Hein est un super hôte.
Il nous a d'abord envoyé un mail avec le descriptif du trajet de l'aéroport d'Amsterdam jusqu'au studio.
Son atelier est juste à côté du studio, il nous a accueilli avec un café et nous à conseillé des choses à faire dans la ville (notamment une super brasserie et un marché pas très loin du studio)."

Thanks again"

Fue una bella estancia y una charla con Hein que me lleno el alma y me dio una sonrisa."
7474662;67375292;2016-03-29;46171698;Gabriela;We strongly recomend to stay at Hein s. He brought us a map with his recomendations. The room was confortable and well equiped. Hein was always avaiable for any help. Very good hoster.

The apartment is a dream: cozy and stylish at the same time. The apartment is located in a lovely neighborhood: quiet with individual restaurants and shops. Just a short walk to downtown.

We would definitely stay there again!"

She pointed us in the right direction with all the questions we asked (bike hire and restaurant suggestions). She was contactable by phone the entire time we were there and hand over of the keys at the end of the stay was easy. Lotte was a friendly, genuine person to deal with and her apartment is in a great location in the centre of Amsterdam.
55256;4325640;2013-04-28;316745;Erin;Lotte's apartment is the best! Really sweet studio in an awesome location, very comfortable, very cool.  And Lotte was great too, super responsive and easy to get in touch with. I'd recommend this place to anyone.
55256;23278642;2014-11-27;22755775;Andrea;Lotte's apartment is very good, very cute and comfortable, the location really close to the absolute centre of Amsterdam. Even if we never met Lotte (which is a pity, but as turists we wanted to visit everything), everytime we asked her about something,she always replied immediately and very kindly. We highly reccomend to stay at her place!:)
55256;24392783;2014-12-27;23421855;Joaquin;Everything was great. The apartment is verry confortable. It has everything it says and the location can't be better. I recommended so much!

The room is spacious; it's actually the living room of the apartment but we still had our total privacy. Lotte was a very welcoming, warm and helpful host! I definitely recommend staying here!"

55256;133723296;2017-02-24;92756562;Pierre;Appartement bien situé, calme et lumineux. C'est un peu le bazar et assez encombré mais on revient aux fondamentaux d'Airbnb et c'est appréciable. Ça n'est pas un logement pour faire du business. Le lit est confortable mais dans la pièce principale sans volets et avec de simples voilages. Pas l'idéal quand on aime dormir dans le noir. Sinon Lotte a toujours été très réactive dans ses réponses. Dommage qu'on ne se soit pas croisés.
702124;2403480;2012-09-24;3496877;Memex;We rented JJ's apartment at the last moment,we were allready in Amsterdam though . He's a great host who wellcomed us in his home as friends.Some wine and fruits for us and roses for my wife. The apartmant is clean,full of light, very warm,positive energy. Tram 4 gets you directly to city center,with bikes it took us about 15 minutes. Neighbourhood is peacefull family area with lots of shops,cafee's, restaurants etc. We're comming back to Amsterdam next year and definitely will stay in JJ's apartment.
702124;11308638;2014-03-29;12630998;Jamie;Janjaap has a very nice spacious apartment. It's perfect for a couple with plenty of room and it is very light. It's a little rough and ready in some places and you will play a game of hunt the light switch if you arrive in the dark, but once past this, you will be fine. It is in a very nice location but parking will be a difficulty. It costs around €15 for the day which runs from 9am to 9pm. At night it is free, but good luck finding somewhere. Janjaap was helpful and flexible to my arrival and leaving time. Many thanks.
8914277;57151793;2015-12-22;30878015;Christie;We loved our spot on the canal. The apartment is as advertised. It is quite modern and stylish with great nautical art. The view of the canal is wonderful. It is centrally located - minutes walk from some of the main attractions and a short taxi or bike ride to many more. It is a quiet location as most of the neighboring suites are businesses. The host(s) were always available for questions before and during the stay and met us at the unit, even though our train was 2 hours late. One heads up - the 21 steps to the suite are a little on the steep side so if you have any kind of mobility issues it may not work for you.
3163509;40624065;2015-08-01;26006603;Frank;"Großartige Unterkunft. Zentral gelegen. Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Auf dem Beiboot kann man in der Sonne sitzen und den Fluss an sich vorbei ziehen lassen. Wir wollten das Boot garnicht verlassen. 
Voll eingerichtete Küche. 
Sehr netter Empfang durch Kwame = Freund von Dennis. 
Insgesamt ein tolles Erlebnis. Wir kommen gerne wieder und hatten definitiv einen Tag zu wenig gebucht."

15038670;135795139;2017-03-06;71362802;Abigail;"Although I didn't actually meet llana (as she was away herself), she was very helpful through messages and would always reply quickly. She was also very friendly and provided lots of good advice on things to do/where to go in the centre and the area local to the flat.

The place itself is very clean and well presented and has everything you need for a long weekend away. It is only one room and be aware that the shower opens straight into the room. This wasn't a problem really, just for people to be aware! It was a good size, the bed was very comfortable and me and my boyfriend would definitely go back!

The location is a good 40 minute walk or so into the centre but we loved this as it is a good way to explore and see the city. If you don't want to walk then it's not a problem as there are great public transport links via tram, bus and train. The area around the flat was awesome too, there are some lovely restaurants that llana will tell you about. Definitely try Walter Woodbury's and the Thai Tiger! 

Overall, a very pleasant trip and great place to stay. I will be sure to stay again when I return to Amsterdam! :)"
1583266;11807999;2014-04-15;13437690;Paulo;"Great place to stay. My wife and I stayed at Murat's flat for two days in April 2014. We did not stay in the flat for a long time, basically it was just a sleeping place for us, as far as we were concerned.  However, it was clean and tidy, and easy to find. Public transport was also plentiful. 

Murat and his wife are a very nice couple and very eager to share information and to be of service. Murat lent us a public transport card prefilled with about €10 of credit which saved us a lot of Money, as the fare is cheaper using the card, however, the card costs about €7,50. So we saved the cost of the card and in the end left Murat the card + €10 for the Money we spent.

I will definetely recommend Murat to a friend or family if they are looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam."
1583266;11960779;2014-04-20;4947360;Lee;A clean, friendly, very comfortable stay! If you want privacy, you have it completely, as the doors to the bathroom, toilet and main door are next to your room and separated from the rest of the house. If you need any help or a friendly chat, they are extremely obliging. All conveniences such as an iron, board, kettle, tea, coffee, biscuits and a fridge etc are provided. I enjoyed my stay and would certainly return!

1583266;28745307;2015-03-29;29167702;Purusothmn Nair;My experience at staying at this places has been absolutely awesome. I was actually quite worried in the beginning because I will staying alone in a new place but the warm welcome by Ela and Murad broke all the barrier. The room was cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable. In addition, I was so lucky to experience the local life in Amsterdam since there is a morning market just at the end of the street Commelistraat. I don't think I can ask for anything more. They provided everything from shampoo till body lotion and this made my packing so easy. I would recommend this place to anyone travelling to Amsterdam.
1583266;34088196;2015-06-04;33899512;Marijke;Ela and Murat were really nice since minute 1. The room is cozy, comfortable and quite pretty, with a relaxing view to a garden.

Good localization, I could go everywhere just by walking, within a 40min walk I could get to almost anywhere in Amsterdam I wanted to go. Public transportation is very good too, 5 min from the house and we could go anywhere without too much effort. I had a great time there, would recommend it to anyone who is traveling to Amsterdam."

The location is prime. 20 min walk to central Amsterdam or a 10 min tram ride. Uber's here are also quite reasonable 10 euros to downtown and 12 euros to leidseplein ( center of nightlife). This is close to the eurolines bus location too. 15 min with the train or a 12 euro uber ride. 

The room is very spacious- with a large, comfy bed with clean sheets and towels provided. There is also a coffee and tea station in the room. Room is on the first floor of the apartment so very convenient if you have luggage. I wouldn't stay anywhere else!"

10198226;127670086;2017-01-20;95521650;Simon;"We stayed at this apartment for 6 days and 6 nights and found it to be everything we could have asked for.

Pros:

Arriving we found the apartment to be even more spacious than we originally thought. The apartment feels very light and airy due to the high ceilings, fresh decor and 3 huge windows which allow light in. The windows overlook a busy street and bridge, which is great for feeling like you're a part of life in Amsterdam. If you like people watching then this location is perfect. The kitchen is well equipped with 4 gas hobs, a fridge, a sink, a kettle and various pots, pans and utensils to cook with. The bathroom is big and has a very nice bath/shower. You can also sit properly on the toilet, without having your knees/head against a wall or having to sit sideways, which is a huge problem i'd found with other hotels i'd stayed in before. The beds folded out easily into double beds, which were comfortable and spacious and were provided with all the linen and bed sheets needed. The TV takes some getting used to, but once mastered you can access YouTube and other apps through it as it's a SmartTV. It also has USB slots if you want to bring your own movies on a flash drive and watch them! It was -5 when we stayed, so having an adjustable thermostat to control temperatures within the room was a huge bonus. We didn't go cold a single day in the apartment and found it really comfortable.

Cons: 

If you're a light sleeper, you may need ear plugs as it does stay lively outside at night because you're in such a central location. I found after the first couple of nights, I got used to it and slept right through any noise. This is hardly a bad point though as this is what you should expect!

The stairs are very steep, but again it's hardly a bad point as it's not something unique to this apartment itself and is actually just how most of the buildings are in Amsterdam. Expect it at the apartment and all over Amsterdam!

Over all I couldn't recommend this place enough. For the price you pay you're getting a comfortable place to stay and the best location around. You're 5 minutes from the central station, 2 minutes from the main part of the red light district. You have a coffeeshop right next door and you're only 2 minutes from the main Amsterdam high street. Couldn't have asked for more! Thank you!"
16212010;131700389;2017-02-13;19863960;Kaitlin;Our stay in Amsterdam was absolutely lovely at Marianna and Casper's place. Perfect location across from the park, right around the corner from many shops and restaurants, and walkable to the Van Gogh museum and other beautiful sites. Kitchen is pretty bare (so if you're staying for a while bring your own amenities), but our hosts left a bottle of wine and chocolates for Valentine's day--very sweet. The space is enormous, clean, and we only wish we could have stayed more days.
16212010;137899758;2017-03-18;10014852;Brant;Marianne was a great host. Kind, extremely quick to respond to communication, open and flexible. Highly recommended!

He makes you feel at home and is ready to help you anytime. We also had interesting talks during the evenings. In the weekend he left us alone and we had the entire apartment for us, he trusted us and we really appreciate that. The apartment is very clean and confortable, you can relax in the living room, use the kitchen and the most beautiful bathroom we've ever seen in Amsterdam. The area is really charming and surrounded by nature and parks, with easy access to the city centre. We enjoyed a lot our stay and strongly recommend Xiong's place!

He is also very friendly and easy to talk to.  A warm and open individual.  His place is very neat and clean.  Though the flat is not in the city core the surrounding area is incredibly beautiful, safe and quite which is a nice break from the hustle and bustle.
761411;22755268;2014-11-13;7773530;Khalil;"L'appartement de Xiong est situé à 5 min à pieds de la countryside (car Amsterdam est entouré d'une véritable campagne) donc c'est IDÉAL pour ceux qui aiment se promener, courir ou faire du vélo.  
Il faut 15 min en bus pour arriver à la gare Centrale (point de départ pour toutes les balades dans Amsterdam) et les bus sont nombreux et réguliers. Les environs de l'appartement ne sont pas très vivants mais au moins c'est calme. 
L'appartement est TRÈS propre et Xiong est également très accueillant et aidant.
J'ai passé 3 jours à Amsterdam et ses conseils m'ont fait gagner beaucoup de temps. 
La chambre est sobre et le lit agréable.
Bref, c'est un vrai bon rapport qualité-prix pour ceux qui aiment les choses simples et pratiques ;-)"

L'appartement est très beau, très confortable, très propre. La salle de bain est de haut standing. On croise des animaux en allant prendre le bus (lapins, oies, pies) ! L'arrêt de bus est à 5 minutes à pied, les bus sont très fréquents et on atteint la gare centrale en 15-20 minutes. Le contact avec l'hôte fut clair et rapide. L'arrivée comme le départ se sont très bien déroulés. Le système de transports en Hollande est excellent et Amsterdam est très agréable. Je recommande.

It was one of my best rentals. The room is cosy, with a little desk that comes in very handy to get some work done. The Wi-Fi was excellent. The apartment is beautiful, very comfy, very clean. The bathroom is luxury. We get to see animals (rabbits, geese, magpies) while walking to the bus station! It's a 5-minute walk to the bus station, buses are very frequent and take you to central station in 15-20 minutes. Contact with host was clear and quick. Both check-in and check-out went smoothly. Holland's transport system is excellent and Amsterdam is a very nice city. Recommended."

761411;76840068;2016-05-29;37668655;Kathrin;Xiongs Gastfreundschaft und seine tolle Wohnung ließ uns sofort wie zu Hause fühlen. Alles war sehr sauber und wir hatten viel zeit für uns, da der, der im Einzelzimmer wohnte fast nie da war. Wir würden sofort wieder kommen!
939698;12112839;2014-04-23;3482272;Cristina;We all had great expectations regarding our stay, and they were totally fulfilled. We had a great time! The communication with Marijke was smooth and friendly both by e-mail and in person. The city center is quickly reachable and the neighbourhood has all kind of facilities (shops, supermarket, playgrounds, etc). Marijke recommended us some cool (not necessarily touristic) places to go, also with children, and we really appreciated the ones we tried. And what to say about the houseboat? It is at least as nice as depicted, really cosy for both kids and adults and just as comfortable as a (comfortable) apartment but with a special, funny, romantic added touch. We miss the ducks quacking us the good morning! Simply out of question to imagine any not-on-water accommodation for our further visits to Amsterdam. We will be back! Thanks Marijke!
939698;12534422;2014-05-05;12470795;Sonja;Wir waren 4 Frauen und das Hausboot war super!! Marijke ist sehr sehr nett und es hat alles gepasst! Man fühlt sich sehr wohl, auch die Umgebung ist sehr ruhig.Was sehr angenehm ist zu dem Trubel der in Amsterdam herrscht! mit dem Bus ist man in 10 Min. in der Central station und man geht 5 min vom Boot zur Haltestelle. Der Bus fährt alle 10 min.Supermarkt ist auch in der Nähe! Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt!
4650761;28816927;2015-03-30;3234839;Maria;Danny was a wonderful host from the beginning of our booking. He communicated all information and instructions very promptly and this sets him apart from many other hosts in Amsterdam who don't take hosting that seriously, so we really appreciate it. He was incredibly kind giving us a lift from the park and ride and he was always available to answer any queries and went out of his way to let us have a late check out. The space is great, well located and very clean with comfortable beds. Well worth a visit, thank you Danny!
4650761;29473084;2015-04-07;2029835;Leo;"Danny was a really great Host! We like his Houseboat...everything was clean and comfortable. I would recommend Danny's Houseboat.
The communication with him works very good and fast."
4650761;31430221;2015-05-05;11218110;Neil;Danny's houseboat is fantastic. Love walking in to the kitchen / lounge, seeing river views and weather permitting enjoying a drink on the deck outside. Quite spacious inside and nice bedrooms. Danny is very welcoming and has knowledge of the local area to help you make the most of your visit.
4650761;34812911;2015-06-12;9658130;Hazlan;"I was initially worried because this is my first visit to Amsterdam and the address given by Danny was quite general (no house number). Luckily, the taxi driver knows the place. Danny was there to welcome me n family.
The house is fantastic. Love the view especially from the balcony. The wifi is great and there is quite a number of English Channel on TV. 
Location wise, not far from train station (less than 10 mins walk). 4 stops from Amsterdam Centraal station. Area is quite safe. 
Overall, it was a great experience to stay in a beautiful boat house. Plus the weather was great during our stay"
4650761;43573680;2015-08-20;33274393;Wisam;Danny has been very friendly. The hause on the Amstel river is charming and perfect for a stay in Amsterdam. It is close to the City and very clean. I would recommend it if you are in Amsterdam. We will diffidently book this again on our next visit   :-)
4650761;72467566;2016-05-02;14287029;Lauren;We absolutely loved staying on Danny's houseboat. There were six of us and we had plenty of room. It was very clean and comfortable. Danny left us a bottle of Prosecco which we enjoyed out on the deck. It was so nice to sit there and watch all of the boats go by. It was in a nice and quiet location but close to a metro stop and some good restaurants, too. The only thing that would make the houseboat perfect would be a dining table. We had breakfast on the houseboat but there was no table to sit at. I highly recommend Danny's houseboat.
4650761;78232954;2016-06-05;57079679;Anna;it was lovely meeting Denny, he welcomed us with wine and great advices about Amsterodam.  the boat is very cosy, clean, well maintained. the location is perfect, close to the city centre but without the noisy night life... we would definitely come back and will recommend to our friends.

4650761;106215264;2016-10-04;60217578;Maaike;De woonboot hat ons goed gevallen. Heel centraal gelegen, snel met de metro in Het centrum. Een mooi terras direkt op de Amstel, Meer Amsterdam gaat niet.

The negative point is that the place was not really clean, especially the bathroom wich musht have been forgotten during cleaning time."

1776018;82956776;2016-06-30;66350591;Dennis;"We spent six days in Lot's ground floor apartment in Amsterdam. We met her the evening before taking occupancy. She walked us thru the apartment, showed us around, asked if we had any questions and gave us the keys. We moved in the next day. This is not a rental property but rather a home where a couple lives with their two children with all their possessions that they must rent only on occasion. The listing's pictures are accurate. We can best describe our experience as renting a room in someone's apartment without having the owner on the premises. The living space is quite large and comfortable. The Kitchen is very functional with lots of dishes, glassware, pots and pans.
The location and neighborhood are wonderful, just off the Amstel River. It is a 20 minute walk to the Museums, near subways and trams."
1784824;32672388;2015-05-20;6223460;Angela;Amazing apartment! Rooftop terrace can't be beat. Quiet neighborhood with lots walkable. Highly recommend.

6828314;40125882;2015-07-28;36793442;Thibault;Logement décrit comme dans l'annonce, un beau appartement spacieux et agréable, le seul point négatif de notre week-end a été la pluie.
6828314;90796063;2016-08-02;39643385;Bob;Ivana and her support team welcomed us to their home with open arms and fresh flowers. Their place is convenient and cozy with all the conveniences of home and is a short walk the tram mini. They are flexible and everything from arrival to departure was worked out. If you are looking for a place just a short ride away from the central area, consider Ivana and Jules home. We enjoyed it.
11094104;63126022;2016-02-20;4905964;Carlos Y Leti;"We spend tree days At michell aparment , the location Is perfect, direct line On the tranv  from the central station and straigt to the airport, close to the really nice área and eassy to walk anywere to the city. The aparment is cosy and spacious , perfect for a couple , we miss a few thinks like the the hair dryer and maybe some small details like toilets accesorys , but other than That everything was perfect . 
Michell was very flexible with the check out , so we had a late flight and that was really apreciated.
Defenetly will recomended to any traveller. And be back if possible Again."
11094104;65564520;2016-03-15;11398208;Francesco;"Our stay was lovely. The flat is quiet and comfy, perfect for a couple or small groups. You can walk everywhere without taking public transport, a cheap supermarket is just a 5 minutes walk and the tram stop is in front of the door if you need it.
Improvements? Some curtains on the windows to sleep better and more control on the heating system, but those were only small details.
Some furniture in the bathroom would also be handy."
11094104;74160477;2016-05-13;65779021;Jonas;Great location. Nice appartement. Friendly contact with the host. We really enjoyed our stay!
11094104;78644015;2016-06-08;7309092;Eric;I liked this place. It was exactly what I needed and the location was perfect.
11094104;79445077;2016-06-12;7851517;Dianne;Michiel's friend met us and graciously helped take our bags up to the apartment. The apartment is as shown in the photos, airy, a good bed, a lovely place to relax.
11094104;80146626;2016-06-16;583526;Mary;Had a great time in Amsterdam--the apartment is in an amazing location and it was super easy to get around. It was just slightly inconvenient when we arrived because we were on time and buzzed the door bell plus called Roberts (michiels friend) name from the street but had to wait 20 minutes to be let in. Leaving was very easy though. Wish there was also more notes in the description about the many steep stairs (my partner has bad knees) but I would still recommend this place to a friend!
11094104;97704213;2016-08-28;88478851;Francesco;Lovely studio and great location
11094104;103167437;2016-09-21;25115955;Alex;"Michiel put me in touch with Robert who I coordinated with to get the keys. Very easy to communicate with and had no issues.

The apartment is cozy and you do have to walk up 4 flights (not an issue for me, but could be an issue for some folks). The location can't be beat and is the reason I chose this place. Right in the heart of Amsterdam. I was able to walk everywhere. The Rijksmuseum is only a 20 minute walk away. Lots of shopping and restaurants right outside. There's also a tram that runs directly outside the apartment.

The apartment had everything I needed, but I didn't spend too much time inside. Perfect location for seeing the city."
11094104;120572024;2016-12-11;7505048;Verónica;"Was very good. 
Michiel was not the one recieving us, but his friend Jan did. He was very nice and helpful and friendly.
We got in very late, and he had no problem with coming to recieve us.

The place has a great location. Close to everything. Simply amazing.
Agree with the rest of the descriptions regarding the staircase, but nothing that young people cannot take. Jan helped us to get the suitcase up.

We got some cold days and the appartment was just right in temperature. No chance to be in short sleeves, but not cold either. Just enough.

He also allowed us to check out later since the appartment was not booked. That really helped!

The only thing I could say is that it can get a bit noisy with the tram stop in front of the appartment. But this was mostly during the day and in weekdays.

Experience was overall very good."
11094104;124166771;2017-01-01;26045801;Daniel;Great place, very central, I would definitely stay here again!
1380875;14900788;2014-06-29;12251114;Nadja;"We rented the apartment from Iris for the whole month of June. The rooms are spacious and the mattresses are comfortable. The house is very good located and it’s not far away from the city center by bike or foot. There is a kitchen where you have the possibility to cook and store your food in a big fridge. In the bathroom there is a washing machine which you can use during the day, except from 2-4 o’clock while Iris is using the machine.
When we arrived, Iris showed us on the map, where we can find groceries. The next day she took us to her friend who rent bikes (Ajax Amsterdam). On this day we talked with Iris about the condition of the apartment. She had renovated the floors and almost everywhere was still dust from the renovation as well as other dirt. The bed and sofa were clean, however when you hit a wall, a door, the curtains, the coatrack or a border, you would have all the dust on your clothes. In the dishwasher we found a moulded wooden spoon and  the cooking stove was also not properly cleaned.
As we speaked to Iris about the state of the apartment, Iris told us “You’re not going to die from dust” and if she would have cleaned the stove properly, it would have taken her more than one hour to do it. Frankly speaking since we stayed for the whole month and paid the rent in advance, we were surprised to find the apartment in such condition and getting answers like mentioned above. 
On the other day, Iris slipped a notice under the door, letting us know, she had arranged a student to clean the flat. She also wrote an e-mail to inform us. The student cleaned for about  1  1/4hours the most dirty places in the flat. 
Afterwards Iris barley said hello to us when we would met on the staircase. Around a week later, we found a big water spot on the floor in the living room, caused by a leak on the ceiling. We informed Iris and she told us, this has already happened before and she would inform someone to fix it. Luckily we didn’t have very expensive stuff on the table beneath the leaking spots.
After this incident Iris did not speak to as anymore except to just say hello.
It was a unfamiliar experience for us – we rent an apartment for one month, paid a full price, get an apartment with renovation dust and older dirt and after we said to the owner “the apartment is not clean” we were treat like we did something very bad to her.
Amsterdam is really a great city and we hope you have a great time there.

1380875;16067225;2014-07-21;15531741;Jo;"A wonderful quirky place that's in a great, great location. It's spacious, spotlessly clean and full of character.  Plus, it was a real bonus to pay less than all of the hotels and get a double bedroom each.

The balcony was a real plus too - it's such a quiet area. Lovely to have a morning coffee on and enjoy the neighbour's gardens. 

The tram system in Amsterdam is wonderful. Just buy a 12 euro pass for 48 hours and get to anywhere in the city. As other reviewers says, it's an easy journey into where the action and nightlife is.

I'd only say that the stairs are VERY steep and narrow. Don't do what I did and take a big suitcase, as you'll struggle. You also have to be quiet at night in the bathroom so not to wake the flat next door - but that's OK.

Iris was great in her communication. Directions to the place were thorough and it was easy to find. Great bars and restaurants nearby too. Recommend Bloemers for dinner and drinks."
1380875;23387601;2014-11-30;3434125;Aline;Great place to stay in nice neighborhood. Even though we didn't meet Iris, we had a lovely stay at her place. My friend and I only stayed for one night but the room was private, clean and good amenities (modern bathroom, small kitchen space). The terrace would be great in the spring or summer time for breakfast or a glass of wine! I can recommend staying here
1380875;23694665;2014-12-08;13105246;Christine;"A really cozy apartment, very well equiped, even Shampoo was available.
The terrace must be amazing in summertime.

I will definitely return to the apartment when going back there."

The appartment is very nice and very quiet, with a real kitchen, a nice bathroom and a lovely terrace. Everything you need is provided : towels, travel books, maps, coffee, tea, sugar and all the basic products you need to cook, internet. The location is very convenient, walking distance from all the points of interest and for the lazy ones, the tramway is one block from the appartment. We'll for sure rent the place again when we'll be back in Amsterdam.

My biggest problem was the bugs in the room. I came out with 15 insect bites in my hands, feet and face. I don't know if they are only from mosquitoes (I saw many) and I wonder if there's also a spider problem. 

Finally, this is an environmentally friendly room so do not expect the best smelling toiletries. Our towels had a funky smell."

3207840;36892969;2015-07-02;16529458;Zhou;Ondrej is a great host in general, even though his not there when we reached Berlin, his colleague managed to settle us in on time. The apartment is spacious and clean. On top of that the kitchen and showering facilities are in tip top conditions. The neighborhood is quite quiet and there is super market accessible in the area. Most importantly, the location of this apartment is great! It is near one of the main train station and it is very accessible to other main tourist attraction places. Overall our experience in Berlin is wonderful and I highly recommend this venue if u were to stay in Berlin.
3207840;55820476;2015-12-06;7318393;Francesco;"The apartment is just like the pictures show: nice and spacious. Unfortunately there was dust under the bed and the sofa; it could have been cleaner.  The towels provided were only small ones, we had to buy big ones to shower . Also , the light in the kicthen wasn't working, and cooking in the dark isn't great."
3207840;66810486;2016-03-24;17400782;Mette;Ondrej's flat is situated in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to busses and not far from a hub station. The spacious living-, dining-, bedroom all-in-one has a high ceiling and a big window to the courtyard. Perfect for two relaxed friends or a young couple with no needs for hotel standards. Easy to make appointments about arrival and departure etc. Great flexibility and kindness.
3207840;84729432;2016-07-08;2769161;Marcela;This place is in a immigrant area in Berlin and they can be quite noisy ! ... children screaming all day ( and adults) and loud music... the place itself looks dirty and even there was a cockroach at the silver wear drawer !  Yes, there was... I didn't feel like cooking at all there !! The cleaning was just in the middle,  I could see the dust under the sofa...  although the communication with the (friend of the) host was very good, when he left we had to figure out ourselves how to get the internet working and how to get some warm water...  it wasn't fully working and some guy from a company in charge wanted to come in some morning to fix it, of course I wouldn't loose time with that !  So... he never said anything about not having warm water...  overall,  I don't recommend this place... there must be better located places... in better conditions, it was by far my worse airbnb place so far
3207840;97160546;2016-08-26;2963293;Fabio;"We spent an amazing stay in Berlin! 
Ondrej's apartment is very nice, clean, cozy and more spacious than it appears in photos! Well located, you can reach the city centre (Alexanderplatz) in 15 min by tube.
The building is really quiet because it overlooks a courtyard and not the street. Also the neighborhood is quiet and residential. 
Moreover, arriving from Tegel Airport it's easy to reach the apartment in 30 minutes by subway and bus. 
We haven't met Ondrej, but his friends Jack and Greta have been very nice and helpful.
Therefore we absolutely recommend Ondrej's place!"
12065917;97177089;2016-08-26;16998845;Maha;We loved Yoni's place. Communication was easy and quick. We were welcomed by Yonis friend (who was nice , friendly and offered to get us what we needed). The apartment is in good location, it was very nice and very clean. Thanks for making our stay enjoyable.

Mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist das Zentrum von Berlin nicht weit."
698727;16051404;2014-07-21;9537185;Horst;Sehr netter Kontakt. Man hat sich immer bemüht, alle nötigen Infos zu vermitteln. Das Haus ist sehr geräumig und gemütlich. Trotz der angrenzenden S-Bahn Strecke sehr ruhig. Eine klare Empfehlung.

The directions Roumiana gave us were perfect and easy to follow, the house is really easy to find and exactly as it is listed. The area the house is in is lovely, very quiet and peaceful, with lots of interesting local shops and cafes about a 15 minute walk away, and 10 minutes walk from the train station which takes you straight to the city centre.
698727;50264423;2015-10-11;7932629;Marion & Bill;This house served us well. We had a larger vehicle and it was difficult to park at times though it was great to have a space available. One shower for many people took some planning to get everyone dressed and ready in the morning though it was nice to have a powder room. We were not able to work the washer which would have been nice to use. Fortunately I have relatives that were able to accommodate that for us. Rooms were adequate and the place was clean. Roumiana was quick to respond to any questions. Overall a good experience.

- relaxed and helpful host
- loft room with spacious shared living room

- there were any curtains, so the room gets pretty bright pretty early"

427854;72884901;2016-05-05;2738775;Joanne;Staying at Niklas's place was great. Everything we needed was provided, the space was spotless, and communication was a breeze. I would definitely stay here again.
427854;103411638;2016-09-22;17172918;Nanako;Niklas' apartment was very tidy, clean, comfortable. Even all those clean bed sheets and pillow covers were prepared. Since I don't live in Europe, to open the house door was pretty difficult and my friend and I had to ask someone on the street but we totally enjoyed our stay at this flat. Highly recommend!
15514414;128921375;2017-01-28;77164874;Sofia;The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

12875272;123424954;2016-12-29;79077300;Anna-Lena;Die Wohnung is fünf Minuten zu Fuß vom Alexanderplatz, sehr geräumig und wunderschön. Es gab zwei große Schlagzimmer, ein riesiges Wohnzimmer mit Schlafsofa, eine Küche mit Esstisch, Bad und eine kleine Extra-Toilette. Alles war sehr sauber, die Kommunikation lief sehr gut und die Gastgeber waren super freundlich. Kann ich auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen.
12875272;139628922;2017-03-26;1379327;Steve;Augustin was very welcoming and accommodating since we arrived quite late, the flat is beautiful and felt just like at home, it is situated in an ideal location, Close to bar and nice restaurant, I would highly recommend this property.
12875272;142455565;2017-04-08;121364591;Giorgi;Great apartment, conveniently located near Alexanderplatz, within walking distance from shops, cafes, restaurants, public transport. Excellent value for the price. Only minor downside is the lack of soundproofing, which means on the one hand that the neighbours (particularly the upstairs ones) are often audible, and on the other that you also have to take extra care not to be noisy, particularly later during the day, as the sound really does seem to carry. But this is not a big deal and hasn't prevented us from enjoying our stay there.

L'appartement était en parfait état, super bien situé dans un quartier qui bouge beaucoup. Un weekend entre filles fantastic!

The flat is really cosy, clean and comfortable:the location is excellent central and hype but  quiet at night, very close to trains and bus station.

1299854;7599127;2013-09-26;7188648;Edwin;"Armin did not give us directions for entering the apartment until the last possible minute, and then only after several increasingly urgent requests. The key box worked with difficulty, and there was only one set of keys for most of our stay; that created inconvenience.  The doorbell did not always work -- more inconvenience.  One of the toilets ran continuously, and it was repaired only after more than two days during which we could not use it.  One of the TV sets did not work.  One of the refrigerators was so noisy that it kept one of our party awake for much of the night.  There are three bedrooms and three bathrooms, but there is no proper living area."
1299854;12049436;2014-04-22;11620307;Maria José;Desde aqui queremos dar las gracias a Armin porque el apartamento es estupendo, bien equipado, limpio, bien comunicado con el centro, etc. La comunicación ha sido clara y siempre correcta.  La cocina, pequeña pero completa con vitrocerámica, microondas con grill, cafetera...un poco escaso de vajilla y sin utensilios para cocinar, pero te puedes apañar bien. Un armario con paños de cocina y cualquier cosa que pudieras necesitar para limpieza: fregona, aspiradora...En cada cama había una toalla de baño y una de manos por persona y en una cómoda, había ropa de cama y toallas por si necesitabas más. Grandes armarios en cada habitación para no tener las maletas por el medio y bien decorado. Las camas, muy cómodas. Ha sido una estancia de 4 noches muy agradable. Sin duda, volvería a alojarme allí.
1299854;14073343;2014-06-11;3428312;Conny;"Ich kann mich in Punkto Wohnung und Anbindung meinen Vorrednern nur anschließen. Die Wohnung ist groß und für fünf Leute geeignet, da jedes Zimmer sein eigenes Bad hat. Das eine Bad ist etwas klein und es fehlen Ablageflächen, aber das sind Luxusprobleme. Die Terrasse ist zum Sitzen sehr schön, die Küche istdafür völlig ungeeignet. 
Was Armins Qualitäten als Gastgeber betrifft, lässt vieles zu wünschen übrig.
Ich habe hier die Antwortmail, auf unsere Beschwerden mit eingefügt.

Wir kamen am Samstag um 15:30 Uhr bei gefühlten 35 Grad im Schatten bei der Wohnung an. Wir standen zu fünft bis kurz nach sechs und haben abwechselnd versucht das Schloß aufzubekommen. Armin hat uns eine Kombination gesendet die nicht funktionieren kann, da man eine Zahl immer nur einmal drücken kann. Unsere war 1227 und zweimal die zwei hat nicht funktioniert. Soviel dazu!

(Gastgeber)Die Kombination hatte der Gast vor ihnen auch, d.h bei ihm hat alles funktioniert. 
(Gast)Der Gast vor uns hatte eine andere Kombination, das hat mir Airbnb mitgeteilt, nachdem ich auch bei Ihnen Hilfe erbeten hatte. Airbnb kann den emailverkehr nachverfolgen ...

(Gastgeber)Das Safe hat bis sie es benutzt haben immer funktioniert. Woher soll ich wissen, ob nicht sie das Safe kaputt gemacht haben. Mich kostet das Safe über 50 Euro. Das meine reinigungskraft ihnen da Safe öffnet, weil sie ein paar mal gegen geschlagen hat, was auch ich ihnen 10x gesagt hatte!!!
(Gast) Als die Putzfrau ankam, sagte sie mir gleich, dass das nicht das erste mal wäre und sie schon oft den Gästen helfen mußte, da der Keysafe nicht aufging! Wir hatten leider keinen Hammer dabei, den die Putzfrau dann zum öffnen benutzen mußte! Die Dame hat das Schloß auch nur aufbekommen, da sie eine andere Kombination gewählt hat.

(Gastgeber)Die Aktion hat mich auch nochmal 50 Euro gekostet. Und natürlich rechnet sich das für mich dann nicht, denn schließlich vermiete ich das apartment nicht weil ich das als finanzielle Einnahme betreibe! 
(Gast) Nein, keine finanziellen Einnahmen? Nur aus Menschenliebe. Die 360 Euro ging direkt ans Kinderhilfswerk?

(Gastgeber)Sie nörgeln an jeder Kleinigkeit und werden wohl nie zufrieden sein. Ihr Aufenthalt ist für mich sehr anstrengend und zeitaufwendig. Ich habe mich sofort mit ihnen Tel. In Verbindung gesetzt und ihnen auch schnellstmöglich geholfen.
(Gast)Ja, ich warte zweieinhalb Stunden, damit man mir die Wohnung aufmacht.
Bei 35 Grad! Das ist für meine deutschen, spießigen Verhältnisse leider nicht sehr schnell :-)). Zudem ging die Klingel auch nicht. Das war sehr ärgerlich, da wir zu fünft waren. Wir mußten uns immer absprechen, wann und wie wir nach Hause kommen. Dafür gab es von ihm leider keine Lösungsvorschläge.

(Gastgeber)Wenn Sie nicht zufrieden sind mit der Unterkunft und sie es nicht mehr dort aushalten können bitte ich sie sich eine andereUnterkunft zu suchen, die Ihren Ansprüchen genügt.
(Gast) Die Wohnung hat voll und ganz meinen Ansprüchen genügt, nur der Gastgeber ließ zu wünschen übrig! 

Nur soviel, der Safe hat funktioniert, wenn die Sonne nicht darauf schien. Also Nachts und bei Regen!!! Ein temperaturabhängiger Keysafe!"
1299854;16762891;2014-08-02;12446095;Ursula;"Die Wohnung ist sehr gut gelegen. Der kleine Garten ist wunderbar!
Auch, dass es drei Duschgelegenheiten hat, ist wirklich sehr praktisch.
Das Inventar der Küche ist spartanisch gehalten."
1299854;18955343;2014-09-03;18589853;Yang;Die Lage ist super verkehrsgünstig! Wir haben Armin zwar nicht persönlich getroffen, aber er hat uns ausreichende Information geliefert und reagiert rechtzeitig auf jeden Kontaktversuch. Gerne wieder!

There was not problem at all with the keys or anything.
Really good recomendation"
1299854;33350898;2015-05-27;26035515;Walter;Wohnung liegt ruhig im Hinterhauses eines Hofes. Anbindung an öffentliche Verkehrsmittel nicht weit entfernt. Parkplatz für das Auto  zu finden kein Problem.
1299854;39724372;2015-07-26;9917269;Stefan;"We went to Berlin together with our 2 children. The rooms were neat and can be darkened. We had many opportunities to park and there was also room to store our bikes safely. Within minutes we were with the bike on the Alexander Place. Opposite the appertement is a large park with green and playgrounds. Nearby are shops and restaurants. The tram passes by the apartment and bus stops nearby.
The contact with Armin went very smoothly and the instructions on arrival were clear."
1299854;51423881;2015-10-20;18914411;Robert;"Gut organisierter Ablauf, Schlüssel ist am Haupteingang in einer ""Lockbox"", Armin übermittelte uns vorab den Code - somit war ein problemloses betreten/verlassen der Unterkunft möglich. Persönlich sind wir dem Host nicht begegnet, er war aber immer tel. erreichbar. Unsere Gruppe bestand aus 2 Pärchen und einem Single. Jede Partei hatte ein eigenes Bad, Wc u. Dusche, somit musste nie gewartet werden - TOP! Die Unterkunft ist sauber, Betten waren bereits überzogen, Handtücher u. Föhn vor Ort. Das einzige Manko war das nicht bzw. nur sehr sehr langsam funktionierende Wifi.
Uns hat es trotzdem sehr gut gefallen und würden jederzeit wieder Armins Wohnung behausen!"
1299854;61672912;2016-02-07;25135080;Adnan;We spent a nice week end in berlin, the apartament was confortable and clean and close to the center, few stops of public transport. Armin is very helpful and understanding. I higly recommend this solution.
1299854;62339221;2016-02-14;47975491;Cathrine;"Leiligheten i seg selv er veldig fin og har bra beliggenhet, rett ved trikk. I forkant av besøket fikk jeg raskt svar på det jeg trengte fra eier. Da vi ankom leiligheten var det ikke vasket. Sengetøy og håndklær var rent, men det virket ikke som noe annet var vasket. Toalett, vask, gulv etc bar tydelig preg av at det ikke var vasket. Wifi fungerte ikke. Den ene dusjen manglet dør og det var ikke feste til dusjhodet. En baderomsdør gikk ikke an å lukke igjen. Jeg skrev til eier med en gang (via Airbnb), men fikk svar først lørdag kveld (dag 2). Da skulle vi dra morgenen etter. Han kommenterte heller ikke vaskingen. Bare bad meg om å prøve å logge på wifi en gang til. Leiligheten i seg selv var fin, så det er veldig synd at det er slike ting som gjør at opplevelsen blir ødelagt. Ikke minst kjedelig for eier som får en dårlig rating på grunn av slike ting som enkelt kunne vært unngått.

Dette var også ting som jeg hadde lest på tidligere reviews og derfor hadde spurt eier på forhånd om kom til å være fikset innen vi kom. Det fikk jeg bekreftet at det skulle være, men det var det altså ikke."
1299854;64280426;2016-03-02;24812352;Ton;"A modern apartment on the ground floor in a renovated building, and it even has a terrace outside. Two double and one single bedroom have new and modern furniture. Three showers, three toilets. There is no sitting room; next to the kitchen is a buffet with bar-stools.
Parking outside is not too easy but driving around the block will find you a parking space. Tram right outside, S-Bahn on 15 minutes walk."
1299854;64812365;2016-03-08;12606180;Simone;Nice basic flat in a good location. Perfect for people that just need a place to sleep and take a shower. Lovely little outdoor space ideal for summer. Really smooth check-in and check-out.
1299854;76446881;2016-05-27;69342101;Christin;"Wir haben zum ersten Mal eine Wohnung über AirBnB gebucht und waren größtenteils begeistert von der Wohnung. Positiv war, dass der Gastgeber uns die Lage sehr gut beschrieben hatte und man konnte gut Kontakt mit ihm aufnehmen. An der Wohnung haben uns besonders die drei Bäder und der Balkon gefallen. Außerdem braucht man nur ein paar Minuten zu Fuß bis zur nächsten Haltestelle. Für kurze Reisen, wie sie auch bei uns war, finden wir die Wohnung super. Nur wenn man länger verreisen möchte, fehlt vielleicht das Wohnzimmer und man fühlt sich in der kleinen Küche eingeengt. Zudem war bei uns die Mikrowelle sehr dreckig, weshalb wir diese nicht benutzten und das WLAN war sehr langsam.
Alles in allem stimmt das Preisleistungsverhältnis und wir waren trotzdem recht zufrieden in dieser Wohnung unsere paar Tage verbringen zu durften."
1299854;77682662;2016-06-02;57306056;Gyorgyi;a képek nem csalnak, de nagyon szűk a hely, nincs egy asztal, a tolókocsival csak bútor átrendezés után lehet beférni,  a fürdőszoba nem elérhető, mert olyan kicsik az ajtók, holott azt hirdették, hogy akadálymentes a lakás.

1299854;107705743;2016-10-11;61825009;Thomas;Wir kamen sehr spät an und deshalb war die hier praktizierte Schlüsselübergabe genial und flexibel. Die Wohnung liegt in der Nähe eines lokalen Verkehrsknotenpunktes. So hat man viele Linien in alle Richtungen zur Verfügung und zwar alles oberirdische, was genau das ist, was Touristen wünschen. Super ist der Doppelstöckeraussichtsbus 200. Er durchquert die ganze Stadt auf einer touristisch optimalen Linie. In der Nähe befinden sich verschiedene Läden, darunter auch drei Supermärkte und ein wunderschöner, grosser Park. Die Zimmer und Badezimmer / WCs sind sehr schön, die Matratzen super, die Küche etwas klein, aber gut eingerichtet, mit Keramikplattenherd und Mikrowellen / Backofen - Kombi. Die Terrasse ist toll. Die Wohnung ist komplett ruhig und sicher, da sie sich hinter dem abgeschlossenen Innenhof befindet. Null Strassenlärm. Die Zimmer haben sehr grosse, moderne, kippbare Fenster, resp. Terrassentüren, mit elektrischen Rollladen und in jedem Schlafzimmer befindet sich ein Kühlschrank und ein kleiner Tisch mit zwei Stühlen. Das WLAN funktionierte einwandfrei, Steckdosen hatte es überall zuhauf. Zur Begrüssung standen im Kühlschrank eine feine Flasche Wein und ein Bier. Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen. Wir haben es total genossen. Wenn wir wieder nach Berlin kommen, werden wir sicherlich versuchen, diese Wohnung wieder zu bekommen.

8385590;51670664;2015-10-22;39989140;Janine;"Bei Karsten kann man sich als Gast wirklich wohlfühlen. Er ist ein offener, sehr netter Gastgeber.  Am Abend meiner Anreise waren Freunde von ihm da. Ich kam in eine klasse Gruppe von Leuten, die mich sogar beim Essen eingeplant hatte, was wirklich super war und ich so auch noch nicht erlebt habe.
Karsten lebt in einer sehr gepflegten, schönen Altbauwohnung. Das Zimmer, das ich während meines Aufenthalts bewohnt habe, ist sehr gemütlich, verfügt über ein Doppelbett sowie einen großen Kleiderschrank und hat einen Balkonzugang. Die Wohnung befindet sich in zentraler Lage. Der Kiez bietet eine Fülle an Ess- und Ausgehmöglichkeiten. Die Verkehrsanbindung könnte besser nicht sein: Fußläufig kann man zur Tram, U-Bahn und Ringbahn gehen. Was ich im Vorfeld der Reise als sehr positiv empfand, war die unkomplizierte Kommunikation. Karsten hat auf meine Anfrage innerhalb weniger Minuten geantwortet und es war kein Problem, kurzfristig bei ihm unterzukommen.  Einen Aufenthalt bei Karsten kann ich definitiv jedem empfehlen! Vielen Dank für alles!"

8385590;136221659;2017-03-09;12414699;Lorenz;Everything was perfect and Karsten very hospitable.
8385590;136710740;2017-03-12;26939769;Justin;"Nice, modern apartment, comfortable bed and an excellent host is maybe the best summary of Karsten's place. We didn't see Karsten too much, but when we did it we always had a nice talk. 

The location is good, though walking to the centre would be a bit far. There are several good public transport options though. Countless restaurants are near. 

Dinner: We recommend Blackbeards for burgers (reserve a table!) and Trattoria Terra Sarda for Italian.

For breakfast/lunch: Bekarei and Beakers, the latter is also a fine place to go for a drink. 

The neighbours can be a little noisy, but usually it's not until late nor is it very long. And there's little Karsten can do about it probably. ;-)

Bottom line: we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend Karsten's place to anyone, especially single travellers or couples."

L'appartamento era fantastico, molto pulito e aveva tutto il necessario. 
Marco e lydia sono disponibilissimi, anche se non li abbiamo conosciuti di persona perché a fare il check in è arrivato un loro amico, Massimo che ci ha spiegato tutto al meglio"
4136858;51482502;2015-10-20;45744180;Agathe;Wir hatten eine sehr schöne zeit in der liebevoll und gemütlich eingerichteten Wohnung von Lydia & Marco! Wir wurden sehr nett empfangen und auch die Kommunikation vor der Reise war einwandfrei. Lydia ist eine sehr gewissenhafte und bemühte Gastgeberin. Wir werden die Wohnung bei unserem nächsten Berlinbesuch wieder buchen.
4136858;69428915;2016-04-11;50586527;Mariana;Marco e Lydia are the perfect hostess ever, I talked to Lydia many times before, during e afterour days in Berlin and they made everything to all be perfect, they explained how we get there, gave us all the tips about the area, how to get the public transports, many superarkets near by, they gave us a map to facilitate our days around Berlim. We get in the apartament around midnight and Marco was wating for us. The apartament is beatiful, everything was perfect, the bed is bed and confortable, it was very warm, the kitchen is modern with all we need. Near to to public transport very easy to get anywhere. It´s relly better in person than the photos. We wished stay a little bit longer in there, if we´ll be back we sure stay in ther and recomend to our friends.Simply incredible
4136858;72217380;2016-05-01;11444269;Niall;Really enjoyed our stay in Berlin. The apartment is cosy and in a convenient spot to get around the city. All amenities such as Lidl and a bike hire shop are nearby. Thanks Lydia!

14509929;148118372;2017-04-30;4834751;Monica;Vielen Dank an den freundlichen Gastgeber. Alles klappte völlig unkompliziert. Das Zimmer ist angenehm und sehr ruhig gelegen. So kann man sich gut von anstrengenden Berlintouren erholen. Es gibt sogar eine kleine Kochecke mit Kühlschrank. Was will man mehr! Und absolut weiter zu empfehlen.
9964643;60337496;2016-01-22;2642989;Timo + Myrien;Wir hatten sehr schöne Tage in Berlin. Die Wohnung ist sehr herzlich eingerichtet und man fühlt sich gleich wohl. Die Fenster & Balkontüre der Wohnung sind sehr alt und dämmen nicht richtig - bei eisigen Temperaturen ziehts dann einbischen. Die Bettdecke gibt aber warm (: Anna Lene's Empfehlungen für die Cafes & Bars in der Nachbarschaft waren super.
14553182;131704024;2017-02-13;70446083;Jon;Rebecca+Burak's place was a real problem at times, because it was SO nice we didn't want to leave and tour the area outside. Burak is a perfect host for the perfect place. We would love to return on our next visit to Berlin.
14553182;134642734;2017-02-28;27002177;Jennifer;This is a beautiful, spacious, and clean private room. Burak was very friendly and communicative during and after our stay, making sure everything was all right. We didn't see much of him, as we were out pretty much all day every day - also he was very respectful of our privacy but was available if we needed everything. Everything you could possibly need is provided for you - toiletries, towels, a guidebook to the area, etc. We had a very pleasant stay here and highly recommend it!
8565139;98278136;2016-08-30;78044157;Ana;I really loved this place! The decoration and every detail was beautiful. Ewan and Hristiyana are such a nice people. They really made us feel like home. Super lightly apartment in a super nice neighborhood. Totally recommended.
8080738;48466025;2015-09-26;12454730;Okan;Beschreibung und Fotos vom Inserat stimmen genau überein. Die Lage der Wohnung war gut für Nachtleben und zu fuss die Nachbarschaft zu entdecken. Fran ist ein freundlicher Gastgeber und auch Musiker, passt die Wohnung ideal für 2 Leute.
14846872;124962198;2017-01-03;35770541;Tori;"This place is absolutely perfect. A great location, heaps of room for two people and great neighbourhood.
The bed was comfortable and Nataly was in contact with us quite a bit so we got her personal tips - it was great!
Our only tip is if you want a place suitable for being out every night and getting home at all hours, this isn't for you... we had to be super quiet around the apartment and in the area because of slightly irritated neighbours. But it was perfect for us as we were out most of the time and were quiet :)
This place is fabulous and I would highly recommend!"
214855;23267908;2014-11-27;6511107;Cheng Cheng;Anna's place in Berlin is absolutely gorgeous. I love the high ceilings and large windows. It's conveniently located near public transportation so it's easy to get to all neighborhoods.
214855;32328858;2015-05-17;14213984;Slabbaert;"My sister and I arrived in the evening around 22.00u. It was no problem for her and she waited until we arrived. It was a very nice welcome and we've got the information that we needed. 
The room was very cosy and clean, the bed was big and amazing:). 
It was a pity that we couldn't see her anymore when we left, but we had a beautiful and nice stay in Anna's room. Thanks for everything!"
214855;35659658;2015-06-21;30798180;Caitlin;"Everything was wonderful!! The room was perfect and so spacious! Everything was clean and the bathroom is a good size too!  We were met upon arrival and given keys, a book with wifi codes, tram information and things to see in Berlin! 
The stay was great and if we go back we would love to stay here again! 

The only negative is the key! It's kind of hard to work, but you tend to get the hang of it!"
214855;38255624;2015-07-14;28604315;Terese;Our experience was fantastic. Anna is a warm host who leaves you in peace but is available if needed. Her knowledge of the local area is great. The room is just as the photos show... light and spacious. The area is brilliant. A short bus ride to mitte. Lots of fabulous nearby cafés and bars, supemarket, bike hire and public transport. We would definitely recommend Anna's air bnb to people visiting Berlin!! Loved it!!!
4666510;33445766;2015-05-28;14562604;Gayle;This was a great apartment to stay in - bright and airy. It was in a good area with plenty of restaurants nearby as well as good transport links.
1266433;103767397;2016-09-24;35870027;Marco;Everything was perfect. Sander and Marrique are the best hosts I've meet so far. The communication was perfect, when we arrive they told us everything about the city and point it on a map. The room is really nice and quiet. It has an independent entrance from the street and the location couldn't be better. Perfect, we would love to come back for a longer stay.
1266433;122093415;2016-12-21;57623268;John;The Library is in a good location, close to all amenities in the centre of Amsterdam but still nice and quiet. Sanders and Marijke were welcoming and helpful. The Library is attached to the rear of their flat and they have set up a little area with coffee machine for the mornings, which was a welcome touch! This is an ideal place for a short trip to the city.
1266433;125529690;2017-01-06;3855914;Nick;Wonderful hosts! If you are planning on coming to Amsterdam look no further. Great location, amazing price, and some of the nicest hosts one could ask for.
1025482;4496110;2013-05-08;4855573;Heather;The house was beautiful and Reinhart and Viveka are a welcoming and lovely family.  Very easy to get to.  Not in the heart of Amsterdam so it's more quiet and still very easy to get to from the train station, plus there are ferries that run all night.  And there's bunnies in the garden!
1025482;6600882;2013-08-18;7983772;Doris;We have a nice time on the houseboat from Reinhart. The place is very calm and near the center of Amsterdam. Reinhart receive us pleasant. We would return to his boat.
1025482;6927098;2013-08-30;8340960;Silvano;"We spent couple of days in the houseboat with our 7 weeks old daughter. First holiday in 3.. It was beautiful! Reinhart was a great host, the boat is fantastic and the garden just amazing! And all that, 10 minutes from the heart of the city! 3 minutes walking from the houseboat there's a boat (FREE!) bringing you just behind the central station. wonderful! 
Thanks Reinhart for the nice evening chat on the little terrace with a great view. we'll come back!  Silvano, Anja & Moa"
1025482;7038071;2013-09-04;7665200;Janet;Had a great stay - lovely people and really good location.
1025482;7302179;2013-09-15;7289528;Alan;The location of Reinhart's houseboat is outstanding for visitors to Amsterdam. It is difficult to imagine a better location. Sadly Viveka was ill while we were there and stayed elsewhere out of consideration. Reinhart did very well on his own. He is open and friendly, and very helpful regarding directions and suggestions. He provided a complete breakfast each day and by giving us keys made the houseboat home for us. A pleasant experience.
1025482;8637617;2013-11-10;377120;Janine;Had a wonderful time at the houseboat!  Loved the location, super-convenient ferry to the station.  Beautiful place and lovely people!  I would love to visit again!
1025482;9526490;2014-01-01;10513638;Jasmine;Thank so much Reinhart,  is wonderful , convenience place and perfect service, highly recommended!!
1025482;9835264;2014-01-13;10781511;Quentin;"Très proche du centre, charmant, calme, propre et spacieux. Le petit déj' hollandais est grandiose et l'hôte très sympathique... Que demander de plus ?
--
Very near from the city heart, lovely, quiet and clean. The typical Dutch breakfast is delicious and the host is very nice... Nothing to add ! :)"
1025482;9890620;2014-01-17;695434;Linda;"This was really nice accommodation. It was very convenient (only a short ferry ride to the centre of the city), and the host put on a great breakfast. My friend and I stayed there during winter when it was very cold in Amsterdam so I was a little worried about the heating and whether we would be warm enough but no worries there. Also the bed was very comfortable and the room was pleasant. Highlight was seeing a lovely white swan swim up to the window in the morning. 

Overall ı would recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere central but still off the usual tourist route. It is very reasonably-priced and clean. Host was also very cool. Friendly without being overbearing. Plus there was a wonderful cat."
1025482;10264539;2014-02-10;1532662;Doriana;"This houseboat is the perfect place from which to explore Amsterdam and, at the same time, is a quiet, relaxing place to ""come home to"" after a long day in the city. It is really comfortable and Reinhart is not only a great host, but is quite open, friendly and helpful. A true gentleman. Highly recommended."
1025482;11504494;2014-04-06;5464660;Lucia;Ich hatte den Aufenthalt auf dem Hausboat sehr genossen gehabt. Der reinste Amsterdamfeeling. Reinhart war zuvorkommend und gab ein paar gute Tipps und Anweisungen. Das Hausboat und die Lage ringsherum sind umwerfend und da unweit von der Fähre die zum Hauptbahnhof führt entfernt, eignet sich hervorragend als Ausgangspunkt für Stadtbesichtigungen. Die Unterkunft kann ich gerne weiterempfehlen.
1025482;14335017;2014-06-17;10898819;Johannes;"The Houseboat was very nice. an realy enjoyed our stay there. Reinhart is a perfect host:)

1025482;16765437;2014-08-02;14204302;Olivier;"Le houseboat de Reinhart laisse un souvenir original d'Amsterdam, surtout le soir avec en fond les lumières de la ville. Très pratique avec le ferry gratuit et desservi en permanence on rejoint le centre en 10 minutes.
Malgré un petit souci en cours de séjours, Reinhart à su parfaitement résoudre  le problème à distance en étant soucieux de notre confort."
1025482;16884082;2014-08-04;13238161;Markus;"Eine super Unterkunft und ein außergewöhnliches Erlebnis auf Reinharts Hausboot ein Wochenende zu verbringen. Wir haben schon ein paar Unterbringungen gesehen aber etwas Vergleichbares haben wir noch nicht erlebt. Ein lüxoriös ausgebautes Boot vergleichbar mit manchem Ein-Familien-Haus. Super netter und zuvorkommender Gastgeber der uns super unterstürzt hat. Atemberaubende Aussicht aus dem Hausboot auf das Meer. Mit einem Wort ""TOP"" und gerne jederzeit wieder."
1025482;19064938;2014-09-06;12101734;Dorothea;Wir haben eine wunderschöne Woche bei Reinhart verbracht. Das Zimmer war schön und wir danken Reinhart herzlich für das Frühstück, das er uns jeden Tag zubereitet hat. Reinhart war ein fürsorglicher und aufmerksamer Gastgeber und sehr rücksichtsvoll. Wir können einen Aufenthalt bei ihm sehr empfehlen.
1025482;20734135;2014-10-05;6081013;Rebekah;We thoroughly enjoyed our unique houseboat experience with Reinhardt. The room was large, bright and airy with lovely water views. It was also very quiet and tranquil so great if you want some peace away from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam Central which is literally 10 minutes away by ferry and tram. The bathroom was divinely clean and spacious and the breakfast very generous.  Reinhardt is a generous who is happy to share his local knowledge and leave you in peace and privacy as you wish.
1025482;22735029;2014-11-13;834567;Meghan;"Fine place to stay in Amsterdam. The location is atypical given the ferry but very convenient to everything. The room was spotless and the bed quite comfortable. All in all great for the price; a unique experience being on the houseboat."
1025482;25072119;2015-01-05;25506593;Stefan;We spent two nights in Reinhart´s houseboat. The boat is lovely, clean and close to the center. Reinhart was very nice and welcome. The room was perfectly equipped- very comfy bed, wifi, books and maps etc. and quiet too. Lovely breakfat selection. 100% recommendation for a short stay. We'll be back.
1025482;25999059;2015-02-01;2254985;Patrick;Reinhart is an excellent host and the houseboat is simply a dlight to be in.
1025482;31758947;2015-05-10;21758851;Uli;"airb&b as its best!
Vom 08.05. - 10.05.2015 waren wir zu Gast bei Reinhart im Sixthavenweg 8. Reinhart ist ein großartiger Gastgeber und findet genau die Mischung zwischen dem Angebot an Kommunikation und Zurückhaltung, die den Aufenthalt in seinem tollen Hausboot für uns sehr entspannt und angenehm gestaltet hat. Die Beschreibung des Hausbootes und die Bilder entsprechen exakt dem, was wir vorgefunden haben. Ein großzügiges und mit Stil eingerichtetes Bad mit Regendusche, ein schönes Zimmer mit Blick auf die Gracht und gutem großem Doppelbett, ein kleiner separater Kühlschrank. Außerhalb konnten wir, eingerahmt zwischen kleinen Gärten eine lauschige Ecke mit Tisch uns Stühlen nutzen. Eine super Möglichkeit, abends nach der Hektik des Tages in Ruhe mit Blick auf die Gracht abzuhängen und den Tag relaxed ausklingen zu lassen. Das leckere Frühstück hat uns Reinhart auf einer kleinen separierten Empore oberhalb seines privaten Bereiches bereitet. Die Lage des Hausbootes ist perfekt und ein gelungener Ruhepol und Ausgleich zur bunten Geschäftigkeit der Innenstadt während des Tages. Zu Fuß in 5 Minuten, mit dem Bike in 2 ( Reinhart bietet gegen geringe Gebühr die Ausleihe von Bikes an) ist man an der Fähre, die alle 5 - 10 Minuten zum Central Bahnhof hinüber setzt. Fahrtzeit 2 - 3 Min. Von dort erschließt sich Amsterdam mit den relevanten Vierteln in alle Richtungen. Wir empfehlen unbedingt die Stadttouren mit dem Bike und bei Interesse die Museumstour mit dem Boot. (Bike immer gut abschließen!! eines unserer privaten Bikes wurde leider in Amsterdam gestohlen). Ob mit der Bahn und dann  hinter dem Bahnhof mit der Fähre in 2-3 Minuten übersetzten (Fußweg dann noch max. 5 Minuten) oder mit dem PKW, das Hausboot ist gut zu erreichen. 
Anreise mit dem PKW : Da seit einiger Zeit das Parken rund um Reinharts Hausboot nur noch zum Be- und entladen für 1/2 Stunde möglich- und ansonsten nur Anwohnerparken gestattet ist, muss der Wagen ca. 1 km vom Haus in der parkkostenfreien Zone geparkt werden. Achtung !! falsch abgestellt kostet der Spaß sofort 90 €. 
Unser Fazit:
Wir können Reinhart mit seinem Hausboot uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen und hatten 2 1/2 sehr schöne und abwechslungsreiche Tage in Amsterdam und eine rundum gelungenen Wohnatmosphäre."
1025482;34696955;2015-06-11;100560;Kim;"Wir hatten 3 wundervolle Tage und Nächte in Amsterdam. Amsterdam macht einfach Spaß! Und gut geschlafen und gefrühstückt haben wir dazu auch noch. 
Reinhart war so wie in den anderen Bewertungen schon beschrieben unglaulich nett. Sehr zuvorkommend und angenehm. Wir haben uns einen Abend gut mit ihm im Garten unterhalten. Er ist sehr interessiert und er kann einem schöne Ideen für den Aufenthalt in Amsterdam geben. Er hat uns komplett Freiraum gelassen die Tage, es hat sich angefühlt als hätten wir die Unterkunft für uns allein gehabt. Sehr angenehm.
Mit der Fähre die 24 Stunden fährt, ist man in wenigen Minuten in Amsterdam City. Das Hausboot liegt sehr hübsch, man hat eine tolle Sicht und es ist sehr entspannend, wenn man Abends aus dem Trubel der Stadt in diese kleine ""Oase"" aus das Hausboot kommen kann. Ein Traum. Wir werden defintitiv wieder kommen. 
Danke für Alles.
Kim und Mischa"
1025482;41195348;2015-08-05;26942881;Lucas;"Reinhart was very friendly and everything was perfectly fine.
We Werke well informed how to get to the city and also other stuff.
The location is perfect for a nice night after a noisy day in Amsterdam.
Everything was perfectly clean and the breakfast was a dream in the morning.
All in all we have nothing to complain.
Highly recommande, would do it again when we visit the city."
1025482;44629744;2015-08-28;9230580;Anne;Nous avons passé un excellent Séjour chez Reinhart, qui a su se montrer un hôte discret et prévenant. La disposition des lieux permet une vraie intimité, la salle de bain étant par exemple directement attenante à la chambre. Le fait de loger dans cette partie de la ville est un très bon plan, le centre-ville est tout-près et facilement accessible par le ferry, et l'eau et la verdure sont au rendez-vous. Le calme aussi.
1025482;45651505;2015-09-05;29820156;Katrin;Unser Urlaub bei Reinhart war super :) ein tolles Erlebnis. Das Hausboot ist genau wie auf den Bildern. Das Frühstück welches Reinhart anbietet ist super lecker! Er ist ein toller Gastgeber, wir haben uns von Anfang an sehr wohl gefühlt. Ich würde jederzeit wieder einen Urlaub auf Reinhart´s Hausboot buchen!
1025482;47609249;2015-09-21;27968875;Cainan;"Reinhart was a wonderful host with a lovely home (houseboat) in the quiet section of Amsterdam Noord. The accomodation looks EXACTLY like the pictures show it and the views are EXACTLY as shown... No photographick trickery here! My wife and I were made to feel welcome from the very first moment we arrived. We were introduced to Reinharts son and shown to our room. As first timers to AirBnB, we were a little bit nervous at the prospect of staying in someones home... whilst they were home but we settled in in no time at all as Reinhart was practically invisible wilst we were there. That said, if you needed anything, he was there in a flash... even letting me use his laptop and printer to check in for our return flight allowing us a relaxing experience at Schipol. As for the area itself, it is located literally 5 minutes from the hustle and bstle of Amsterdam city centre and the Red Light District, bars, coffe shops etc. That said, once you get on that free ferry that runs every few minutes, 24 hours a day (and is always strangely full regardless of the time), you arrive into a different world. We awoke each morning to a lovely heron, some swand, ducks and moorhens. The sceenry was second to none. The accomodations itself were impeccibly clean and the bed was properly comfortable. And the breakfasts... magnificent!

I simply hope not too many people read this lest his calendar fill up for our next trip to Amsterdam.... because I know that Reinharts home will be the very first place I look when searching for a place to stay in this beautiful city."
1025482;48377464;2015-09-26;25374632;Ursula;"We enjoyed staying at Reinhart's house boat.  Reinhart was a gracious host and provided us with a lovely breakfast each morning.  The location was superb, as we were able to park our car, walk to the ferry and catch any streetcar we needed.  There is a lovely cafe right next to where the ferry leaves, and it is where we would have a hot soup and a drink after a busy day.
Thank you, Reinhart."
1025482;56185002;2015-12-10;34276606;Ben;"Reinhart was an excellent host, and was kind enough to make us a fantastic breakfast every morning. We also rented a couple of Reinhart's bikes for the day at 5 Euros each, which both worked fine. The instructions for finding the houseboat were very clear. The house boat itself is located opposite the Central Station, and you'll need to get a free ferry (which runs 24/7 and takes no more than 2minutes) in order to get to and from central Amsterdam. 

Would definitely stay again."
1025482;57556977;2015-12-27;21066305;Christine;"The houseboat was in very nice location (on water); I liked that it was away from the city but yet very conveniently close to it. I truly enjoyed the entire experience and would recommend this stay :)"
1025482;77389848;2016-05-31;5469039;Scott;"Peaceful haven from the busy-ness of the Central Station area! 

Reinhart's float home on a tiny dead end canal a 2 minute ferry ride and walk of a few hundred meters from the Central Station, is an oasis of quiet and stillness.

He was very responsive pre and post booking, and was able to accommodate us to drop our bags a couple hours before check in time. His lovely home moves gently with the water's motion, and the large bedroom and adjoining bathroom is simple and well appointed. 

The bed is super comfortable and with opening windows on two sides, the fresh air is delightful as you listen to the birds in the evening and early hours. Breakfast was a nice array of breads, spreads, coffee, tea and juice with cheese and soft boiled eggs, and Reinhart is a professional person who is friendly and engaging, but leaves you lots of space. Ideal.

The location is the best part. The 3 minute ferry ride to North Amsterdam where the float house is, runs every 5 minutes and runs through the night, and unloads right at the water side of the Central Station. Then it's just a five minute walk to Reinhart's private dock space with small onshore garden.

Recommended to anyone who wants a quiet place to unwind after the hectic pace of downtown Amsterdam."
1025482;83178861;2016-07-01;1563725;John;Reinhart is a GREAT host and we really enjoyed our stay in his home.  Super friendly, helpful, and whips up a fantastic breakfast each morning!!  The houseboat is very comfortable and in a cool location, within easy access to the Central Station in Amsterdam.  No hesitation in recommending this listing.  Thanks Reinhart for making our stay in the Netherlands special!
1025482;84871069;2016-07-09;53295865;Jens;Alt svarede til vores forventninger.
1025482;95753719;2016-08-20;25176107;Pavel;"Жилье на воде очень соответствует голландскому духу. Все в точности как на фото, удобная кровать, тишина, очень удобно расположено для начала всех видов путешествий - как по городу так и в пригороде. Единая отправная точка - центральный вокзал, до которого 10 минут (пешком по приятной местности + бесплатный паром, который ходит круглосуточно и очень часто) Рейнхард - дружелюбен, в меру общителен и почти не виден.
Завтрак сугубо континентальный, но вполне достаточный."
1025482;103048721;2016-09-20;37849028;Andrew;Reinhart's pad was wonderful!  The boathouse itself is anchored on the north side of Amsterdam, a short (free!) ferry ride across the river to central and all of the happening stuff.  Great shower, comfortable bed and unbeatable scenery/cool factor.  There's a fenced in garden on the property with a small patio that overlooks the Amstel and you can walk to and from the station, food, drinks, etc. in about ten minutes.  Even faster on a bike!
1025482;115506115;2016-11-25;23880717;Shelby;Reinhart's place is great! There is a free 5 minute ferry that runs 24 hours from the central station to the side where the house is. Then it's just a 5 minute walk! The area is beautiful, and the house is even better! The views from the houseboat are unbeatable and so is the breakfast that he prepares for you! 10/10 recommend!
1025482;127794366;2017-01-21;27266525;Emer;Hands down the best location in Amsterdam.  Such a short distance from Centraal Station, but still a really quiet and peaceful place.  Beautiful.  Def check out the cafe in the nearby Filmmuseum, for an incredible view of the IJ.
1025482;132173950;2017-02-16;11983735;Brian & Barbara;Quiet scenic and a short hop to the Center of the city . We walked everywhere
1025482;135941037;2017-03-07;57259283;Pamela;"This is a wonderful experience! I was surprised by how close the boat is to the ferry and that the ferry literally runs every 5 minutes and only takes 3 minutes to get to central station.....then you are right in the centre of the city...yet this location is quiet, secluded and very peaceful...the best of both worlds.  Reinhart is an excellent host...very laid back and friendly and very willing to provide suggestions for touring, restaurants, etc.  
Overall, I would highly recommend this unique experience... a great way to get a true taste of Amsterdam."
15574525;124248937;2017-01-01;33643748;Kenny;Very clean and comfortable apartment and just a short tram ride away from the city centre. We arrived late on the first day but Matheus was still very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay and made great breakfast for us every morning.

9058595;57593304;2015-12-27;9892759;Hagar;We had a great time in Yassien's apartment! The apartment is located just 10 minutes walk from city center and very close to the central station as well. It was very comfortable and clean, and Yassien provided us all we needed. He was very responsive and extremely nice. Definitely recommended!
9058595;59066673;2016-01-06;3651818;Doug;"Yassien was able to accommodate our late arrival in Amsterdam which was great! His place is very centrally located in Jordaan and made for very easy exploration of the city, both by foot and by bike.

The apartment was very clean and was more than enough space for my friend and I. 

Yassien was very responsive to our questions and was a more than gracious host!"
9058595;62706170;2016-02-16;19852081;Amanda;My husband and I had a wonderful two-night stay at Yassien's. His apartment is exactly as the pictures show and was absolutely immaculate. He provided linens and more than enough towels for the two of us. Yassien's communication was prompt and kind, and he was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived. We had to check out very early to catch a train, and we were simply able to leave the keys in the apartment, which was super convenient. The neighborhood is wonderful - you're a 10-15 minute walk to the central train station, there are multiple sweet cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood, and the neighborhood itself is picturesque and seemed very safe. There is a fantastic antique/flea market right out the front door as well (Nordmarkt I believe), which we really enjoyed! Yassien was also very helpful to give us directions to a few sites and recommendations to a few places. A wonderful host.
9058595;126732605;2017-01-14;32261784;Alejandro;"Nice short stay in Amsterdam city!

Yassien couldn't came to give me the keys because work (I really understand) but he sent his adorable sister. She gave me a nice welcome and explained to me all necessary things for the apartment and to make me feel comfortable.

The apartment its big and spacious with a really nice front view. Central heating works so great and nice wifi.

I really enjoyed the shower room. It's quite hard to find a proper shower room in an old flat but the really do! and really nice heated!

Little terrace to have your tea in the morning facing the back garden. The terrace needs a little bit of maintenance.

Nice area full of authentic dutch Bars and restaurants.

In general terms, We had a nice stay!"
2735075;14666266;2014-06-23;16895353;Dawid;"The house we stayed in was very nice. The owners were very helpful and caring. In terms of location the house is located in north part of Amsterdam, therefore if you don't want to use bike or car/taxi it is a bit long walk to the city centre, but there is bus option as well.
The place looks exactly the way how Karin presents it on the attached pictures. Neighbours were no problem to us at all.  Honestly I can recommend this accommodation."
2735075;19224555;2014-09-08;16410872;Trees;"Samen met mijn zussen een heerlijk weekend gehad in Amsterdam.
Een warm welkom door Karin en we konden met al onze vragen bij haar terecht. Alles wat we nodig hadden was er in het huis, zelfs de poes liet ons gewoon onze gang gaan. Prima bedden een fijne badkamer en een goed uitgeruste keuken. Met de bus waren we zo in hartje Amsterdam  en met de gehuurde fietsen waren we binnen een half uur weer terug via de gratis veerpont. In de tuin was het goed toeven bij het vuurtje en het uitzicht was echt landelijk. Een schone gewone buurt, we voelden ons meteen thuis.
Dank je Karin voor je gastvrijheid we hebben ervan genoten."
2735075;24868777;2015-01-03;24645391;Janine;"Wir hatten ein paar unglaublich schöne Tage über Silvester in dem wirklich charmanten und liebevoll eingerichten Haus verbracht.
Unsere Gastgeberin Karin hat uns super auf den Aufenthalt vorbereitet, sodass die Anfahrt zum Haus, Schlüsselübergabe, die Wege mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, Taxinummer einwandfrei funktioniert haben.
Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr ruhig und süß anzuschauen.
In die Innenstadt kommt man mit dem Bus innerhalb von 15-20min.
Mit dem Taxi haben wir rückzu vom Hauptbahnhof bis zum Haus an die 40€ bezahlt.

Zusammengefasst: Jederzeit wieder gern!"
2735075;29976085;2015-04-15;662977;Elena;Karin is an amazing host. She provide all the information needed. the house is amazing with great views and more than we needed. thank you very much, you exceed the expectations.
2735075;31889947;2015-05-11;20881668;Maxime;"We have had a perfect weekend in Amsterdam and absolutely enjoyed our stay in Karin's house! The neighborhood is quiet but so close to the city. The house is decorated beautiful and there is plenty of space as the house has a big kitchen with a big table and even a couch and 2 seats! But also a living room. To be honest, we have spend most of the time in the kitchen, enjoying the garden as well as the sun was shining. 

Karin and her husband welcomed us with some nice food for  breakfast and a bottle of wine. We felt absolutely welcome and could call them any time if necessary. 

Also we could use their bikes, which we used discovering the city. Think using a bike in Amsterdam is the best way, as Amsterdam is THE city of bikes. Waaaauw. 

Thanks Karin and Eddy, you have an amazing, comfortable house and you are great hosts! Absolutely reccomend this place."
2735075;74751121;2016-05-16;33594945;Thomas;"Karin's house is a really nice place.
We spent good time in it and all is made to feel good.
Downtown is not so far by bikes. 
I would recommand this place !

Thank you for everything

9165626;109024495;2016-10-18;56458393;Jannika;The apartment was even better and more spacious than the pictures tell. Very well-equipped kitchen and fast internet. The neighborhood was nice and peaceful and had very good connections to the city center. The only downside that I can say is that it would have been nice to have two sets of keys. Otherwise our stay was a very positive experience and I would definitely recommend this apartment.

782254;12507367;2014-05-04;14302761;David;Daniela was amazing in her hospitality. Her home was cosy and comfortable, and the location was absolutely central.
782254;115887300;2016-11-27;5260452;Brianna;Daniela's flat is amazingly located in central Amsterdam. It is extremely spacious and 4 of us stayed very comfortably. The living area is a great size to relax in and enjoy. The stairs up are steep but there is a lift available if needed. I would happily stay again!
14624429;99028093;2016-09-03;89497483;Abdul;Roland's aparment is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam! Very comfortable and bright.

We can't wait to stay here again :)!

Fedde has the cutest flat ever,

11769632;124103061;2017-01-01;23538379;Han;The studio was nice and tidy, it had everything you needed for a city holiday. The location was great, near to city center and very close to the Amsterdam's most famous market 'Albert Cuyp'. Alex was very nice and helpful.  We did enjoy our stay and we will definitely recommend this place!
13160068;96228517;2016-08-22;55940922;Rabea;Our stay was great! Naoufel made us feel very welcome and we could always ask him if we had any questions. The apartment was very clean and exactly as shown on pictures. He even set the table for us in the morning for our breakfast. Should we come back to Amsterdam we will definitely try to stay here again :-)

We recommend !!!"
13160068;100382456;2016-09-09;17972713;Katie;Flat was lovely and clean. Accommodated our early entry time, and even offered to drive us into town when we ran out of cash for the tram! Tram stop is literal 1 second from the flat so very safe and takes you right to the centre in about 25 minutes and isn't expensive. Can use all amenities in flat so cooking etc possible if necessary. Nafouel was lovely when we met him (even provided some bits and bobs for breakfast) and was never around from mid afternoon and all night so plenty of privacy available too. Would recommend!
13160068;101363771;2016-09-12;77577732;Johanna;Nice and comfortable place. In front of the tram stop, very convenience to go to the city center. Naufel is very gentle and help us with everything.

Leyla was a very caring host, personally greeted us with detailed directions and helpful tips. She provided us with welcome beverages and was always in contact. Apartment is very centrally located with a beautiful view of canal. It was a truly unique Amsterdam experience!

16083074;129635171;2017-02-01;54061051;Clayton;Satoru was a great host. The room was exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Great location as you can take either public transit or walk to anything within 30 mins. Overall, great room if you are traveling with one or two people.
16083074;131843563;2017-02-14;2756438;Lianna;A great place to stay in a cool neighbourhood. Lots of cute shops and cafes in the area and not too far to walk into the centre. Very comfortable stay and Satoru was friendly and helpful.

It is not far from the bus station, there's a bus every 5 min and it takes 30 minutes to go to Centraal, so it is very easy to go to Amsterdam. The location is ok, the neighborhood is very nice and quiet so we really enjoyed our stay!!
Thanks again to Sandra!"
5925158;37316717;2015-07-06;5364166;Paul;A very well located apartment right in the heat of the action. Even though the bedroom is at the front of the apartment and on a busy street the double glazing cuts out any excessive noise. The kitchen/living room is very well equipped. Great for preparing breakfasts and meals with produce bought from the nearby Marqt supermarket. The living room has a nice balcony which offers nice green and peaceful views. The toilet and shower room is a bit of a squeeze but I think this is more than offset by the great location.
5925158;40904960;2015-08-03;20840148;Domenik;"Denise war eine wunderbare Gastgeberin. Vom ersten Moment an, wirkte sie bemüht und bekümmert um uns. Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit im Amsterdam.

5925158;48992269;2015-09-30;14560406;Steven;Denise was great. We didn't have phones and she was waiting to help us in the apartment. The neighborhood was nice and cute.  The apartment was fine and we were comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small.

Thank you, and we will definitely be back!"
5925158;55843040;2015-12-06;49767963;Dikla;"Easy arrival from central station. The apartment is lovely and clean, the bed and the sofa double bed are comfortable. The apartment has everything needed for a comfortable stay: equipped kitchen, towels, nespresso, wi-fi and lovely small terrace. Close to Cafe places and supermarket.
The area is very great and central, 7 minutes from Dam square and 5 minutes from the flower market.   We had wonderful stay! Denise made us feel at home :)"
5925158;59526876;2016-01-11;52034782;Cj;This was only my 2nd AirBnB experience. That said, the apartment was very well-maintained, comfortable, and the host provided a number of nice amenities. That being said, there were a few small issues: notably the transfer of sound from people walking on the (hardwood) floor upstairs, late at night. Other than that, the experience was very good.
5925158;61837991;2016-02-08;16275643;Rory;Beautiful thoughtfully decorated apartment that is v quiet so perfect for sleeping while also being very central. Great host who has obviously put alot of thought into making the place perfect.
5925158;68076093;2016-04-02;48411824;Krista;We enjoyed our stay at Denise's 9 Streets apartment. The location of the apartment is excellent - an easy walk to everywhere we wanted to go. Denise was very responsive to all email communication and was very helpful once we got to the apartment. Gerrit met us immediately on arrival and was very helpful with info about the apt and surrounding area.  We were comfortable in the apt - everything was provided for - even a welcoming bottle of wine. Very thoughtful! Wifi was reliable.

The apartment itself was beautiful and just the right size for an overnight stay. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Denise was so friendly she left us guides for Amsterdam and let us leave our luggage so that we didn't have to walk around Amsterdam with it. Thank you to Denise for making our experience pleasurable and we would certainly stay here in the future! Xx
5925158;82177384;2016-06-26;63303241;Ivan;"Denise estaba esperándonos para darnos todas las indicaciones respecto al apartamento, el uso de los distintos electrodomésticos y demás accesorios que tenía para nuestro servicio.

Tenía para nosotros una botella de vino y una de agua como bienvenida. Contaba con mapas de la ciudad y nos explicó como recorrerla y sus principales sitios de interés.

La cocina, el baño y las habitaciones estaban completamente equipadas. El apartamento tiene ventanas insonorizantes por lo cual dormimos sin ningún tipo de ruido. La cama y el sofacama eran muy comodos. El baño aunque pequeño fue muy funcional. Tiene un tocadiscos con acetatos que pudimos escuchar y la TV tiene Netflix.

Su novio nos ayudo a subir las maletas, y esto fue de gran ayuda pues el único problema que tiene el apartamento es que no tiene ascensor y subir y bajar el equipaje requiere destreza.

El barrio es muy central para ir y venir sin problema."
5925158;88455306;2016-07-24;14788977;Til;What a nice appartment and the hosts were very friendly - thank you Gerrit. It was just perfect! Definitely a great place to Star!

5925158;123678192;2016-12-30;14863997;John;The host was at the flat upon our arrival. She gave us a quick tour and then departed. The neighborhood is centrally located in a posh part of town with shopping and a local grocery store just down the street on the corner. The flat was clean and as pictured.

5925158;135445992;2017-03-05;5135550;Caitriona;"My friend and I spent two fabulous nights at Denise and Gerrits apartment. It's right in the middle of the 9 Streets area, which is one of the nicest parts of Amsterdam and much more relaxed than the centre! Even though it was on a busy shopping/social street, we heard nothing at nighttime and slept like babies in the lovely comfortable bed! The apartment has all that you need in terms of facilities, wifi, coffee, iron, hair dyer etc, and a really nice additional perk was the record player which provided the soundtrack for our weekend in classic tunes from The Beatles and Elton John! We loved every minute and wished we had another night to stay in this little oasis of design and charm! 

Helpfully, the hosts also let us store our luggage on the last day so that we didn't have to drag the bags around the city (especially helpful since it rained on our final afternoon!) 

Thanks again, Denise and Gerrit!"
5925158;138135182;2017-03-19;5356893;John;Great location. Walkable to everywhere!

Although, it small but perfect for vacation in amsterdam ( location is more important than the size of the room).
Warm hoter in the shower - 24/7.
Good wi-fi!"
16624284;134136948;2017-02-26;8317642;Adam;Marco's place is definitely a bit spartan.  But despite the dorm-room feel, the room was comfortable and clean - and definitely in the middle of the action. I highly recommend this place for a weekend trip - if you're here for longer you may want a bit more space.

Unbelievable location,  five minutes to city center by tram.  was working out in hoopddorp and easy 20 minute train from city center.   denise was incredible in her communication and the apartment was fantastic.  just as described.  would stay there again next time in amsterdam.   can't recommend it enough.
4296384;62199673;2016-02-12;3698812;Valeska;Paul is a great host and we felt welcome from the very beginning. The appartment is tidy and nothing is missing for having a pleasant stay. The location is very good, especially the tip for the P+R (in case you come by car) came in handy. Thank you very much!
4296384;63090990;2016-02-20;25903614;Erin;Paul is an excellent host, super friendly and quick to respond. Paul has an eye for art and it shows, his flat is cozy and welcoming with character to boot. The neighborhood is great with plenty of cafes and whatnot and the location is perfect for coming and going as a tourist. Added perks like coffee and bikes made for a wonderfully Dutch experience.
4296384;69096983;2016-04-09;34127310;Giulia;We had a great time at Paul's place. The room is clean and cozy and provided with everything you need for your stay in Amsterdam. Breakfast is delicious, you have a great choice among many kind of food! Paul was really nice and even managed to get us tickets to the Van Gogh museum. The house is about 20 minutes walking/10 minutes by underground to the central station, and the stop is very close to the house. We absolutely recommend this place to everyone who wants to discover the best of Amsterdam!!
4296384;97273836;2016-08-26;3058627;Sasha;What a fantastic Airbnb! Paul is full of great advice for Amsterdam. The museum pass is so handy as well as the bikes! Biking is really the best way around. I was a little apprehensive to use them at night as I didn't know where I was going but they were the best and Paul was very encouraging and helpful. His apartment is super tidy and very easily located. I came at night and he even offered to collect me from the metro station. One of the best Airbnb hosts. Thanks Paul!!! Happy travels!
4296384;104588286;2016-09-27;6853570;Jarvis;Paul made every effort to accommodate me as I was only visiting overnight. I was met at the door and shown where everything was. The extras that Paul provides were better than most places I have stayed before. He had a large selection of coffee, breakfasts, croissants and spreads. The flat was only 150 metres from a metro station that can be reached from Centraal on any line, which makes it very convenient. Hopefully next time I will get to stay longer.
4296384;109516902;2016-10-22;55764386;Judith;Paul a été aux petits soins, disponible pour l'heure d'arrivée que nous avions fixée et idem pour le départ tardif le lendemain. Excellents contacts avant le séjour (sur les horaires, le lieu, accès par métro très facile) et petit déjeuner à tomber !!! Ne change rien Paul, c'était excellent.
4296384;110129217;2016-10-24;93022685;Emily;"We stayed at Paul's for two nights and it was everything we hoped it would be! Paul is a lovely, considerate and helpful host, who knew more about the popular tourist attractions of the city than any Tourist Information Centre we visited. We had an absolutely fantastic time and would not hesitate to stay with Paul again. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your home!

4296384;110264892;2016-10-25;98173832;Rowan;Amazing house. Paul was very personable and welcoming, He helped us a lot as well. It was a short walk into town, but it's a nice city to walk around. Bikes were available but we enjoyed walking the Canals on foot.
4296384;111955524;2016-11-02;16642095;Neisje;Paul is a genuinely kind, accommodating, and helpful person. He is very knowledgable and is very willing to share local know how. Paul goes out of his way to make sure you have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The room has a cozy amount of space to relax in, the bed is comfortable, and as a bonus, the shower is tall and has good water pressure. There are many qualities to this listing, like proximity to the metro, access to a washer and dryer, a reusable OV Chipkaart, and flexible check in/out times in a quite neighborhood that make this an ideal place to stay. The fact that Paul has bikes available for use is invaluable. It is hands down the best (and cheapest) way to get around Amsterdam, and Paul's place is only about a 15 minute straight shot ride from Centraal Station.

7359247;51749679;2015-10-24;29646649;Jean Marc;Logement fidéle au descriptif, idéalement situé et approprié au profil d'une petite famille pour un séjour sur Amsterdam
8387594;58901269;2016-01-05;50366633;Joel;Great host, fantastic location, reasonable price, and very clean and nice!  Made for a great stay in Amsterdam!
8387594;60319064;2016-01-22;153805;Karen;"This is a beautifully decorated flat and the location is excellent for seeing all the sights of Amsterdam.
However, I could not sleep past 3.30am and was disturbed every night as there is a very special coffee shop downstairs which closes at 4, even on Sundays. The temperatures were zero and below but the Dutch patrons were impervious and seemed to stand either end of the street singing or shouting to each other before wobbling off on their bicycles at around 4.30. My daughter was a heavier sleeper and was only woken by a ""heavenly"" choir once in the four nights. Lovely place guys, but think you need to invest in some double glazing inside your beautiful sash windows."
8387594;80017231;2016-06-15;4729496;Sebastian;"Communication with the host was easy and reliable from the beginning. The location of this Airbnb was just fantastic. Several tram lines just one block away. 

The corner room was located on the 3rd floor in the building and there was spiral stairs throughout. Kitchen and the living room area were on the 2nd floor and it was very clean and nice. 

Julia's mother was let us in when we arrived and she was so kind and helpful.  Our corner room was very clean and really well organized. The floor was un-leveled, so you might feel dizzy little. It was spacious for two people and the shower room was great. 

We worried about previous reviews regarding noise from outside, but I think it solved before we arrived since the windows in the room were already updated. We slept like a baby at night and there were high quality ear plugs for the guests, but we didn't need to use them. Overall, we were very happy with our room and we will recommend this place to any other travelers. 

Thank you so much for having us Daniel and Julia!"
8387594;84975116;2016-07-10;24480582;Ian And Yulia;Excellent hosts. Great location. They did install double pane Windows, but did need to wear ear plugs at night. Super clean and beautiful space.
8387594;100434838;2016-09-09;8178979;Chris & Diana;"If you go to Amsterdam, you MUST stay with Daniel and Julia-Beth.  Their apartment is sparkling clean and sunny; newly renovated and in the perfect location for touring.  Only a block from a major tram line that will take you most places you want to go; or you can simply walk.  Shops, bars, restaurants galore all at your feet.  They are so welcoming, (but not overbearing) and gave us space in the fridge and cabinet, as well as offering coffee and tea.  Plenty of privacy if desired, and helpful advise.  He even ordered us a taxi to take us to the airport on our way out.  I can't say enough good.  A perfect stay in a beautiful city."
8387594;101767153;2016-09-15;76484549;Khalil;"It was a unique experience, location was spot on, apartment super cool.
View from the bedroom is spectacular.
The hosts were super friendly and super helpful all the way, Julia-Beth thank you for the teuntje tip, awesome place.
We will come back soon :-)"
8387594;103986458;2016-09-25;853832;Katie & Kris;We had a great stay and Julia Beth is an awesome host! The house and the room are just as pictured - gorgeous windows, bright clean room and really comfortable bed. The private shower and sink in the room's bathroom were very nice, and the shared toilet was just outside our door. The double pane windows really are amazing in blocking out the noise. We also used our white noise machine and with that on we didn't hear anything. The apartment couldn't be more well located - it is right in the middle of everything. The kitchen is very well equipped and we enjoyed cooking and hanging out in there. Overall it was a lovely stay and we'd highly recommend!
8387594;130503538;2017-02-06;29435313;Charles Edouard;Très agréable. Emplacement génial. Propreté et moderne!

The aparment location is perfect easy to reach close to city center. I would definitly recommend this apartment. Thanks Deninis for our great stay."
1875331;25422122;2015-01-15;3077332;Staveren;Dennis was erg flexibel. de vlucht was verlaat en we konden een andere tijd afspreken. leuk rondgeleid.
8377415;51079262;2015-10-17;6075143;Vojislav;"Natascha and her boyfriend welcomed us very friendly,
The apartment is exactly as on the pictures.
The bed is excellent, the view amazing!

The neighbourhood is really cool, with nice restaurants and shops nearby. Also a beautiful park is just across the street.
I stayed with my wife and we had a wonderful time.
I would highly recommend Natascha's apartment."
8377415;77760251;2016-06-03;27862798;Jacob;The pictures don't do this place justice....a truly nice place to unwind in Amsterdam.  A lot of open space....enough for a small family, full kitchen, bathroom, and great views of Westerpark.  The rooftop terrace overlooking it all makes for a great way to start your day and end your night.  Natascha and Cello were there to greet us, give a tour, and provide a welcome gift....truly wonderful hosts.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to indulge and relax.
8377415;82700199;2016-06-28;8814332;Lisa;"Natascha and her boyfriend Cello were the perfect hosts. I had been let down from another air bnb host 2 weeks before my trip and paniced! I mailed Natascha to see if her apparement was free and im glad my last apt canceled. When we arrived we were early which her boyfriend had no problem accommodating. Cello and natascha gave us the tour, showed us the amazing roof top balcony! And left us to start our holiday. They had beers in the fridge and cava waiting for us which was a lovely touch! They were totally friendly and laid back.
The apartment itself was spacious, quirky and beautifully finished. Natascha has spent alot of time with small details which makes the space feel like your at home. It looks over brilliant park that always has something going on in it. The cafes and clubs are brilliant in it too. To walk into the tourist part of amsterdam would maybe take you 25 mins. The area Nataschas place is in you wouldnt need to head all the way in to the centre though as there is plenty to see and do.
From the minute we got to this apartment we relaxed which was what our holiday was all about. We were able to leave checking out until 3pm, we could come and go as we pleased, anything we needed we could send natascha a mail. I would highly reccomend staying here. I will most certainly be back. 
Thanks for a great experience!"
8377415;91584088;2016-08-06;22065485;Wendy;Wonderful apartment. Well- appointed and really comfortable. Would highly recommend. We were greeted with a bottle of prosecco, Amstel beer, and a helpful list of local restaurants and attractions.
8377415;107587627;2016-10-11;11254020;Harris;Had a lovely time visiting Amsterdam and staying at this lovely apartment.. great location and close to lots of interesting places.. the place is clean, spacious and very comfortable with views over the park. Our hosts did absolutely everything to make our time enjoyable and communication was excellent. Only downside was that it's on 5th floor so a bit of a climb and also a bit of traffic noise during the night if you are a light sleeper. Overall an excellent experience.
9460078;58579092;2016-01-03;43824095;유균;"It was really good time!
They are not host but friends
And room was very warm, clean and has a private bathroom.
it will be great time if new guest accomdate in this room.
Amd if you come from central . I recommend to buy 1day ticket
i will miss kevin&karen!
P.s) kevin is so mich much  funny"
9460078;59136706;2016-01-07;47832354;Kevin;Kevin & Karen were fantastic. They were extremely welcoming and maintain a beautiful home. Located right next to a bus stop, it does not take very long to get into the main part of the city. Although we spent most of our time out exploring, it was very comfortable to come back to at the end of the day.
9460078;65353589;2016-03-13;24523574;Guglielmo;"We've spent two awesome days with Kevin and Karen, really nice people. The house is really clean and comfortable and everything needed is provided. 
We recommend it absolutely. The place is 15 minut to the central station, really easy to find."
9460078;69919404;2016-04-14;50024605;Michelle;Kevin is an amazing host! Super fun and considerate... And even gave us a lift to the airport on his way to work. The room is nice and cosy, though slightly on the small side, but we could chill out in the living room with amazing freshly brewed coffee so it didn't matter so much. Location wise... It's very convenient to get to the city but by no means is it walking distance to the tourist places. Quiet, peaceful area away from the bustle of the city but there's really nothing to do nearby. Would definitely stay there again if I ever went back to Amsterdam!
9460078;86308863;2016-07-15;65456635;Carolin;"Kevin is a really nice and positive person. He is very friently,hospitable and helpfull.
Everthing was great!  :)"
9460078;87269668;2016-07-19;16458589;Lenny;"Kevin was a great host! extremely welcoming, personable and very clean. The apartment is in a quiet suburb just outside of Amsterdam, which is nice if you've been traveling around cities for a while. The neighborhood seems very safe and comfortable. The people are also so friendly. One man stopped his Sunday morning ride to help us with directions. I highly recommend a walk around Duivendrecht, it's very pleasant. 

The public transit is really easy: just a short bus ride to Duivendrecht station and then take the metro in. *word of advice: once you get there MEMORIZE the bus schedule! it's extremely useful especially at night when the busses only run once every 30 min. Otherwise, it's a short 10-15min walk from his apartment to the station. But after a long day of sightseeing, you really just want the bus to drop you off right in front of the apartment.

True to the description the room is indeed very cozy, ceilings are a bit low but the bed is great! fits two people very comfortably. Kevin kept everything really clean and runs his service like a professional. That being said, Kevin was always open to speaking with us and we really regret not taking more time to chat. 100% would recommend Kevin and would look to stay with him again if I ever return to Amsterdam."
9460078;98836447;2016-09-02;6642609;T. E.;"Kevin is just brilliant! Every time I come to Amsterdam I try to stay with him, which works only in 1 of 10 cases, because he is always booked and I can book only on a very short notice ;) So, on one hand I want to recommend him, but on another I do not want to recommend him, so that there are more free slots for me ;)"
9460078;106842325;2016-10-08;49892479;Aurelien;"It was a pleasure to stay in Kevin's house! Close to public transportations. Everything I needed was there. Really enjoy my stay there. 
Thanks"
9460078;112740149;2016-11-07;12278441;Alexandra;"The place is great, very comfortable and cozy. The neighborhood is quite and really beautiful. 
Kevin is a great host - very nice, responsive and thoughtful. 
I totally recommend his place."
9460078;131844883;2017-02-14;109522114;Ella;Kevin was a wonderful host! Communication and check-in was both very smooth. He is very accommodating and welcoming. Great location, quiet and quaint neighborhood close to the metro and bus stops. Very clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay! Would highly recommend!
9460078;135077234;2017-03-03;99320181;Arthur;"It was really nice to spend a few days at Kevin's house. He is very welcoming and does everything to make you feel at home. He has also some good advice and it's always nice to have a discussion with him.

The big + is that you feel really at home because you have a big bedroom with your own bathroom / toilet. Kevin works during the day so you can use the living room (thanks for the PS4 ;) ) and the kitchen. He has a very good coffee machine!

It is really well deserved with the bus at front of the door, so you can reach the metro and then the city center in 20/25 min. 
There is a supermaket at 5min by walk. 

The shower is a bit used by it's okay. It was a bit cold when I was there but I'm sure you can ask Kevin to fix it."
16074521;134399002;2017-02-27;76180212;Ruhy;A great place for a group of friends or a family to stay and enjoy the city! It was a simple walk from the center and very clean. The apartment is charming and open, with plenty of sunlight and space!
13503525;91888321;2016-08-07;33725331;Francesca;"My family and I had a great time at Michiel and Jane's place. The apartment is amazing as it seems from the pictures.  It is very clean and well kept. It is also close to museumplein (about 10 minuts walking) and to a metro station. 
Moreover, the hosts answered all my questions very kindly and rapidly.
So, I definitely recommend it!"

L'appartement était très clean et conforme à la description. Il n'est pas trop loin du centre, ce qui était assez pratique pour nous. Si un jour je dois retourner à Amsterdam je ferai à nouveau appel à Enrico et sans hésiter !!!

C'est un très bel appartement, très spacieux et lumineux. Il est parfaitement équipé et très facile d'accès depuis le centre d'Amsterdam. Nous sommes restés deux nuits et ce fût très bien! A refaire !

7812608;48729131;2015-09-28;41797568;Caroline;Advertentiebeschrijving en foto's waren zeer accuraat. Buurt is ideaal, heel veel restaurantjes, tramhalte vlakbij, rustige straat. Appartement was heel netjes, mooie nieuwe inrichting, zalige douche. Eigenaars hadden fruitsap, melk en wijn voor ons klaargezet, en er waren ook doucheproducten en handdoeken, ideaal! Ook erg flexibel ivm aankomst en vertrek. Zeker een aanrader!

7812608;52981035;2015-11-03;25024458;Emma;We had a great time at the apartment. We were 4 people staying for a week and we had no problems. Mik & Isabelle were good hosts, easy to communicate with and even bought us breakfast and a bottle of wine as we arrived. The apartment is fresh and it's easy to go everywhere with tram 4. Can warmly recommend their place!
7812608;79358801;2016-06-12;54329970;Carsten;"Isabelle and Mik have been fantastic and very helpful hosts! The appartment is very tasteful and nice decorated. It was very quiet and even the fridge was filled up for breakfast - just great! The location is perfect to start exploring the city by bike. We were also able to use two bikes from Isabelle and Mik, which is a big plus in Amsterdam.

Overall it was a perfect stay and we would love to come back soon!"

It's realy easy to find the venue ( that is ideally located ) ,  and the apartment was perfect, realy clean,warm, designed, and well furnished ! 
Isabelle and Mik are very welcoming, it's always easy to communicate with them, and they offered us a bottle of wine and some croissants ! That's realy nice ! I thanks again them for everything.
So with friends or with your family , it's definitely the best place for your stay in Amsterdam ! For sure , we ll come back soon for another great week end in Amsterdam !!"

Homemade strawberry jam was delicious and went amazingly with the croissants which were provided for breakfast!
Comfortable, clean, well situated and good value apartment. 
Only thing we would change is an additional mirror in the main room (not just in bathroom) as we are 4 girls who all needed to do makeup.
Would definitely recommend to our friends and family!"

Desde que entras en el domicilio, todo son detalles para hacer mas cómoda y facil la estancia. Todo lo puedes resolver con los escritos q te entregan a la llegada. La casa es bonita, limpia y muy tranquila.Muy recomendable."
12258399;94594307;2016-08-16;81852721;Zsuzsanna;Choosing this house was the best decision we made, this allowed our trip to Amsterdam to be perfect. The house was great, very clean, spacious and had everything we needed. The neighborhood is quiet,  perfect for couples and families. Excellent location, everything is near with bus (center is 15 minutes). Ralph and Julia were super nice :) Julia welcomed us when we got there. They gave us some really good tips on where to go, where to eat and what to see. We could really feel that she genuinely wanted us to have a good time. I highly recommend choosing this houset if you want your trip to be perfect.

thank you!!!"
1328500;31428307;2015-05-05;12629741;Melissa;We were two families, 4 adults and 4 kids and this house was the absolute ideal. The kids didn't want to leave it! Great playground at the doorstep of the house. Jake and Samira made us feel very much at home. The location of the house is unbeatable - on foot, 10 minutes to the Anne Frank House and 15 minutes to the museum area with lovely streets, cafes, shopping and picturesque canals in all directions. The only thing with the location is to be aware that three of the four bedrooms face a street and you are choosing a home in a city, so it will have the usual scooter and tram noise. We're city dwellers so were used to it and it didn't bother us much.
1328500;123196800;2016-12-28;95638729;Peter;Our family of seven adults and two children (seventeen months and four years) stayed in this spacious first floor apartment for four nights over the Christmas period. It is family home well provisioned and comfortably heated. The large lounge is ideal for entertaining and the kitchen/diner provided a table which easily seated our party of nine and three guests for Christmas dinner. All the attractions are within walking distance and public transport is available within a couple of minutes walk.

It is 20min by Tram to the central of Amsterdam. Wilfred is a friendly host who offerd us some chips and wine. I can recommend staying at this appartment for visiting Amsterdam.
5494065;56093049;2015-12-08;31331127;Morgan;Alex had a beautiful spacious flat that I really enjoyed my time in. The view of the garden was beautiful though the sun was very low at this time of the year.

Breakfast was provided, and delicious! There is a beautiful park right next door that we greatly enjoyed as well - a very nice bonus! We would definitely recommend this listing.

The cats were very sweet too!"
13611183;113629209;2016-11-13;9377095;Marc;Kriz did everything possible to make my stay pleasant, and always asked about anything I needed. Her cats are endearing cuddly creatures, and  will also leave you alone if you prefer. The location is right on Flevopark, a nice open spot on the edge of the city. Not quite as central, but nicely away from the crowds, and a short tram or bike ride in. Also, not far from biking in Noord area outside the city.
13611183;128019548;2017-01-22;34730917;Lorenzo;Kris is very kind and gave me valuable advise to enjoy the city. Everything was wonderful, highly recommended!

8625254;65521962;2016-03-15;32304631;Laura;Von was a wonderful host and the apartment was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. We arrived a little earlier than planned and Von was very flexible and able to meet us sooner to give us the key. The location can't be beat, centrally located in the Jordaan neighborhood and on the ground floor. It's approximately 5 minutes to the Anne Frank House, and 10 minutes to the central square, train station and red light district. Von also had some guide books if you are looking for things to do during your stay. I highly recommend Von's apartment!
8625254;72590584;2016-05-03;48605152;Bryony;"Arrived back from a lovely stay at Von's place. She was welcoming and very helpful throughout our time in Amsterdam. The Flat is spacious,  has everything you need and is very well decorated. 
My favorite part about this listing is the location. If you are looking to be close to Amsterdam's highlights but without the hustle and bustle of the city centre then you cannot go wrong. There is also excellent bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets close by and the ice cream shop along the road is a must!

When we return to Amsterdam, we would book with Von again. Highly recommended."
8625254;74647286;2016-05-16;3571072;Franck;We loved staying at Von's place for our first time in Amsterdam. She's very friendly, she texted us during our stay to know if everything was ok, and her appartment is perfect! The location is great, with many restaurants and cafés, and we'll try to come back! Thank you!
8625254;76948609;2016-05-29;53705003;Diego;La experiencia fue genial. Los anfitriones son gente encantadora, el apartamento es más grande de lo que parece en las fotos, genialmente decorado, con flores, muy cómodo los colchones para dormir, tiene de todo. Además tiene microondas, te dejan para desayunar productos de alli (bizcocho, galletas, etc) e incluso una botella de vino.El barrio lo tiene todo, pizzeria, heladeria, bares, restaurantes, la mejor tarta de manzana y tranquilidad para pasear y descansar, todo ello en el centro de Holanda a 5 minutos de la casa de Anna Frank, o de los canales más importantes. Repetiríamos al 100% seguro.
8625254;78604963;2016-06-07;41740512;Matthew;Von was an excellent host and made our stay in Amsterdam wonderful.  The apartment is in an excellent location, full of places to eat and within walking distance of everything in old Amsterdam.
8625254;88575684;2016-07-24;25908663;Kit;My boyfriend and I loved staying in Von's apartment during our trip to Amsterdam. It's in a great location and you can easily walk to most areas from the apartment. Von was so helpful and nice throughout our stay and we would definitely stay again!
8625254;97569037;2016-08-27;59468999;Elaine;Von was great about checking in with us and making sure we had everything we needed.
8625254;98029915;2016-08-29;62853478;Beatriz;Staying at Von's was the best airBnB experience I had in all of Europe. She is super communicative and oh so nice. The accommodations were also amazing, the bed comfortable, the sheets soft, the towels! I would totally recommend this place. Close enough to Central that we walked most of the time. But the best thing? It's on the fist floors for the win and she gave us two keys. Thank you Von!
8625254;110703087;2016-10-28;98005569;Gary;"Von was very welcoming and friendly.
The area was safe,clean and lots of amenities."
8625254;127130771;2017-01-16;22140433;Julie;"Nous avons passé un excellent week-end dans le charmant studio de Von. Idéalement placé dans le quartier du Jordaan, tout est accessible à pieds et très rapidement. 
Seul petit bémol, l'appartement est en rez-de chaussée, ce qui ne se voit pas des photos et qui nous a surpris à notre arrivée mais nous nous sommes vite rendus compte que beaucoup d'Amstellodamois vivent sur la rue.
Beaucoup de petits restaurants sympas à proximité, je vous recommande ""le Bleu"" où nous avons très bien dîné, et les jus d'orange pressés en petite bouteille de l'épicerie juste à côté !
Von est une personne charmante, qui nous a remarquablement bien accueillie."
9473593;59650684;2016-01-13;47607713;Manuel;We stayed here for 8 nights, and were very happy with it. This apartment was exactly as we expected: modern, clean and spacious. We loved the neighbourhood because of the many bars and restaurants in the vicinity. But if you don’t want to go somewhere: the kitchen is well equipped. The apartment is also well located for public transport (bus and tram). We didn’t use the garden in this season, but I reckon it is nice in summer. Would visit again.
81982;334218;2011-06-25;719808;Jack;"Not quite what we expected. Martin was a nice enough host, but the ""houseboat"" is actually a barge and is moored alongside another barge (who hang their washing out across your view). The ""houseboat"" is a 20 minute tram ride from Amsterdam city, so it is not close to the centre of city tourism of at all.
The bedroom is accessed via a trapdoor, and very difficult to escape from at night to get to the loo. BTW, you share the loo, bathroom, kitchen and dining table with Martin (and his lovely daughter some times). The web photos are a bit deceiving.
When we paid the very high price for a 3 nights stay, we at least expected to have the place to ourselves.
As mentioned, Martin was very hospitable, but it may be a unique experience for some young people, but not recommended if your over 50."
81982;643257;2011-10-18;1254577;Dieter;we really enjoyed the hospitality of Martin! his boat was nice for a long weekend and exploring Amsterdam was nice. The boat is a bid outside Amsterdam but with public transportation you will be in the city in 20 min. Good place to be!
81982;3981884;2013-04-01;5337516;Dylan;Martin was absolutely wonderful. My girlfriend and I stayed on his houseboat and had a great time. He was a great host and we are so glad we were able to stay with him, his daughter, and his cats. He gave us suggestions on places to go in Amsterdam and was very friendly. I would recommend him highly.
81982;11700369;2014-04-12;13915884;Dorothea;Thank you Martin for such a great time on ur fantastic boat in Amsterdam! We really enjoyed your company and would love to come back one day :)
81982;19514224;2014-09-14;16519288;Arne;Alt perfekt og meget nemt at køre til. ( ca. 500 meter fra nærmeste motorvej ) og en super placering hvis man vil nye lidt af det maritime look.
81982;22367346;2014-11-04;7164407;Thomas;Really nice stay on MS Martin Luther King. Perfect way to enjoy your stay in Amsterdam ! We felt really welcome on board, thanks Martin !
81982;30881533;2015-04-28;12107580;Veronika;We stayed 2 nights with Martin, for Kings day and night, great place to rest after a day out in the city. The houseboat of Martin completed the perfect Amsterdam experience. Martin is a flexibel relaxed host. 2 thumbs up.
81982;32195771;2015-05-15;15186989;Jean;Martin est agréable et très ouvert. Il a le sens du contact. Il est chaleureux. Son bateau est ancien (100 ans environ), plein de charme, très propre et bien situé. à 10mn à vélo du centre-ville et à 5mn à pieds de tt commerces.
81982;39191536;2015-07-21;7782155;Lukas;"Everything was nice at the boot.
Martin has a realy sweet cat.
The kitchen and the terrace was great.
the bed is very comfortable.
You have two supermarket their.
You also can swim in front of the boot in the amstel.Martin has also a good music box.
I realy want to come back."
81982;49229135;2015-10-02;41890942;Thomas;"Very friendly, helpful host. Not intruding at all. I felt very comfortable and safe. 
His space is cool. Good vibe. Great for a little run in the morning."
81982;51946757;2015-10-25;44821825;Marlon;Es war einfach wunderschön , sauber , warm und Martin ist eine ganz besonders netter Und zuvorkommender Gastgeber ! Immer wieder gern
81982;78856118;2016-06-09;1551139;Danielle;"Martin was a beyond wonderful host. He was home to meet me though my flight was delayed, and was available throughout my stay for anything that came up. The boat was clean,  easy to find and close to everything. I rented a bike and was no more than 15 min away from all the sights and travel destinations.  
 Martin shared his favourite spots and as a result I didn't have a bad meal during the entirety of my stay. The neighbourhood itself was full of great restaurants and cute cafés. I would and will definitely stay here again on future Amsterdam trips."
81982;113914715;2016-11-14;99239794;Neil;Martin is a very friendly and welcoming host. The accommodation is exactly as advertised and everything is at hand. Travelling into the centre of town is very easy using the tram which is only a 5 minute walk away. If you are staying in Amsterdam staying on a barge is a must!
71231;1243578;2012-05-07;2254496;Anand;The best part of this apartment is its location. Centrally located in Amsterdam, you can quickly reach the main attractions and be back quickly to rest or grab a bite. All conveniences are close by and the apartment as such is comfortable.
71231;2235216;2012-09-08;3461249;Will;"I was a First time AirBNB user, booked Philipe's wonderful place the night before we were due to arrive - Philipe was really fast getting back to me. 

The place was fantastic, really nice large apartment - big double bed, plus a pull-out bed that was very comfortable to sleep on too. 

It's a great area to stay in too - short walk to museums, canal boat tours, restaurants and markets. 

For anyone who has never visited Amsterdam (or The Netherlands), you need to know the stairs are quite steep in most places, and Philipe's is no different. This can make getting large suitcases or bags up and down challenging."
71231;4017202;2013-04-03;5224225;Nikhil;The reservation was canceled 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
71231;4179478;2013-04-16;4901001;Bobbie;We enjoyed staying at Philipe's apartment for our first visit to Amsterdam.  The apartment was comfortable and clean and the location was perfect for visiting sights around the city. There are two coffee/breakfast locations and a public transportation stop within a block of the apt. It was also great having perfectly working WIFI so we could plan our days.  The entry steps are very steep and noise from people at the nearby bars can be heard until about 2:00 am.  However, we slept well and I would highly recommend Philipe's apartment.
71231;6601364;2013-08-18;6921656;Holly;The apartment was in a great location.  Really loved De Pijp area!  There are a lot of bars and restaurants around the apartment.  It was bit noisy at night due to bar downstairs.  Also, it is on the second story and the stairs are VERY steep!  Overall had a great week in Amsterdam!
71231;12284440;2014-04-28;8703759;Catrine;This is a great apartment. Perfect for us 5 friends. It had everything we needed. We liked the neighborhood, close to shops, restaurants and bars. Philipe seemed like a really nice guy, and he was so helpful and flexible. We loved your great guide you gave us :-)
71231;33307451;2015-05-26;1449607;Daniel;"Philipe is a very nice guy, the apartment is pretty cool in a really awesome neighbourhood. I would stay there again!
Thank you Philipe!"
71231;79717121;2016-06-13;71026077;Daniel;Philipe was really flexible with check in timings, we landed at near midnight and checked out at 4am. His apartment was clean and in a great location, not too far from Centrum, and also close enough to museums that we were able to walk everywhere. The apartment was clean and 5 of us were able to stay there comfortably without any complaints. We loved the balcony and the apartment complex. Thanks Philipe!
71231;135546167;2017-03-05;65225338;Ryan;Great apartment, easy to get into town. Perfect for a weekend away
4419248;66261937;2016-03-20;45664357;Daniel;I had a great time at Jordi's studio. It was perfect for my stay.  It was easy to get around with the trams nearby and biking into central was quick and scenic.  It was clean and bright and came with a nice rooftop. Grocery store across street, cafes all around, and foodhallen next door. If you have a large bag, like I did, I would be mindful that the stairs are narrow and steep and it is the 3-4 floor. Yet that's all part of the Dutch experience so I was okay with it this time around.
4419248;101165911;2016-09-12;30471344;Łukasz;Everything was perfect: location, apartament, roofdeck. Jordi is a very nice guy and flexible with check-in and check-out time. Worth recommending for 100%.
4419248;109521724;2016-10-22;24793335;Magnus;Fantastic flat! Jordi is great too.
4419248;137562004;2017-03-16;107023867;Shamiah;I would recommend anyone traveling into Amsterdam stay here. The location is perfect with a tram stop right in front. You can get to central Amsterdam within 15 minutes. So you're close to the fun, but able to enjoy the scenery that Amsterdam has to offer. Jordi is a Splendid host! However ladies, if you're able to pack lightly. Please do! The stairs are VERY narrow. I didn't realize how extreme it was until arrival. Overall, stay here and enjoy everything Amsterdam has to offer.
14339440;94168167;2016-08-15;40352732;Hamza;Super friendly host, welcoming and helpful. The room was nice. I recommend to visit Xushui Aimsterdam with airbnb.
14339440;97603790;2016-08-28;43686018;Shaban;Awesome host. Willing to go that extra mile and I highly recommend. It is easy to get to from the central station (takes one busl Thanks for the great stay Xuhui and the wonderful tea.
14339440;133705949;2017-02-24;41616569;Winston Jr;Xuhui is a great host. Very friendly and responds within seconds.
14339440;139030319;2017-03-23;42477929;Junko;The location was good,and the room was clean and nicely decorated! But most of all, Xuhui the host was such a nice man who likes communicating! I really recommend this place to stay .
4039210;31975325;2015-05-12;31124304;Wanda;Ein schönes Zimmer in einer schönen Wohnung in einer relativ zentralen und wirklich angenehmen Lage.
17521777;136786097;2017-03-12;117747593;Hannah;Great and accommodating host! The apartment is newly renovated and close to public transit!
4366938;85863214;2016-07-13;8621889;Shane;Great apartment. If you do have an opportunity to stay here you will not be disappointed. Be mindful this is a walk up apartment. Fantastic canal views. Very comfortable apartment to explore the city from and retreat to for solitude and sanctuary.
4366938;124229776;2017-01-01;107925122;Bill;Brilliant 10 out of 10 apartment
16640578;132314409;2017-02-17;23139729;Jakub;"A great place in a prime location, coupled with a very unique arrangement. Very clean (which for Amsterdam, isn't always true), and very homey inside.

Warning for some: bathroom doesn't have a door and is beside bed, so if a couple is traveling and one has early wake-up, not ideal."
7492758;46207505;2015-09-08;554116;Miki;"This flat is perfectly located in the Oud-West neighborhood of Amsterdam. We literally walked everywhere from it, only using public transportation to get to and from the airport. It was such a pleasant stay! The flat is bright, clean, spacious, fully-equipped, and comfortable. Everything you need is provided. There are markets, restaurants, bars, and shops located right just a short walk away and several tram lines are easily accessible as well. Mattijs left us very clear and detailed information about the flat and the city which was very helpful because we did not actually have a chance to meet him in person. His friend was there instead to welcome us and make sure we were all set. We felt right at home and were sad to leave!

We're explorers and love to be out and about all day but, as a host myself here in California, I think it's important to know that there's a school located right behind the building and when the kids come out for recess, they are quite loud. Also, seems like there might be a DJ or music producer of sorts living in the adjacent building as there were several days and nights when we heard and felt loud music. It never went past 10pm or so. Those are the only noise factors we encountered. Luckily, nothing ever disturbed our sleep. Also, the bed is VERY soft, another good thing to know. We prefer a hard/more supportive mattress. And yes, there are tight, steep, spiral stairs leading up to the flat...which is apparently normal for Amsterdam. Good exercise! ;)

Other than that, it's perfection! We would absolutely stay here again if we ever returned to Amsterdam! 

P.S. Watch out for the bikes!!"
7492758;101198766;2016-09-12;91062413;Khaled;It was my first time using Airbnb , The apartment was clean and in a good location. The host was very friendly and very flexible with check in and the check out. My only complaint is that the apartment had no AC .
10651327;68171687;2016-04-02;62961032;Falke;Alles is perfect verlopen. Mig was zeer flexibel in het moment van aankomst. Er is alles wat je nodig hebt, zelfs een lavabo in de kamer. Het huis ligt in een tuinwijk en op korte tijd sta je met de fiets in het centrum. Kortom, zeker een aanrader als verblijfplaats.
10651327;69082228;2016-04-09;20612774;Matteo;Mig is helpful and friendly! The house is very comfortable and in a quiet quartier! Nice place to enjoy amsterdam!
10651327;80064704;2016-06-16;65801135;Anna;Such an awesome place to stay! Really nice house with plenty of space. Close to a bus stop so it's easy to get around, too. Mig is super friendly and made me feel so welcome while I was visiting, and also gave some great advice on what to do and see in Amsterdam. All in all, I really loved my stay!
10651327;83949256;2016-07-04;27863832;Paolo;"I'd say that the overall feeling about this stay has been positive. Mig welcomed us and gave us the chance to use 2 of his bikes for free, which saved us time and money. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood not far from the ""pier"" where you can get a free ferry to the centre of town. By bike it would take a total of 15/20 mins to reach the centre of town, ferry included. The only downside was the cleanliness: our room was pretty dusty and generally dirty (clean sheets and towels have been provided though) and so were the shared areas (toilet and kitchen). 
Overall we consider ourselves satisfied enough, but we'd have loved a cleaner environment."
11278289;98902270;2016-09-02;7383900;Jean-Marie;We had a lovely time at Parisa's place which is true to the pictures and description. The Jordaan neighbourhood was perfect for us, close enough from the center yet offering its own relaxed atmosphere. Though we didn't meet Parisa in person, communication was clear and easy. Thank you Parisa
7292814;50439627;2015-10-12;125627;Thomas;Fantastic place,  fantastic canal view, everything in the apartment worked perfect. The apartment is really great and the host is very serviceminded. We can only recommend this apartment to everyone who wants to explore Amsterdam from its most beautiful side.
7292814;112676047;2016-11-06;6743835;Caroline;Such a beautiful place! The most wonderful view and so cozy. An ideal location. Naomi was so sweet and helpful when we arrived.
4544589;110077280;2016-10-24;40016571;Brent;"Lovely place to stay, public transport is very close which makes this house perfect for a city trip to Amsterdam! 
Nice beds, lovely shower, large living room, garden, ... 
The house is located in a quite neighborhood. 
Would definitely recommend this place to other groups!"
4544589;115951647;2016-11-27;5624517;Courtney;Karen was a wonderful host, extremely responsive, very friendly and welcoming. Her home is comfortable, well stocked with amenities and very clean. Gein station was a close walk and key points in Amsterdam were very accessible. Availability of parking was a nice plus!
4544589;123426001;2016-12-29;57553303;Poppy;Clean and tidy. Thanks Karen for your warm welcome and help!
14003968;109057596;2016-10-19;95749473;Martin;Melanie picked me up at the bus stop and was very helpful, although she has her daily working life. We had contact by sms, by phone, by (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), by airbnb, by email. When I was in need for help, we communicated efficiently and the problem was solved. Everything together, I was fully happy.
7704803;66161267;2016-03-20;25510089;Roberto;What a wonderfull choice!! Per noi è stata la prima volta con airbnb e siamo stati molto contenti. E' un esperienza che consiglio e la barca/casa Jupiter è veramente bella e situata bene in città. A 5/10 minuti da tutto. Richard è stato molto ospitale e gentile.
7704803;83256871;2016-07-02;72905736;Clay;"Really excellent experience. Richard is a great host; friendly and helpful. The houseboat is beautiful and in a fantastic location. I thought it might be a bit noisy, but since the Magere Brug is a pedestrian bridge, there wasn't much street noise at all. Highly recommended!"
7704803;110416562;2016-10-26;96806909;Sarah;Richard was very helpful. He showed us how everything worked and was easily available if we had any questions.
17509209;138182170;2017-03-19;118784454;Juan Ignacio;Staying at Foppe's studio was excelent! I was warmly welcomed, the place was clean and comfortable... I would say it was better than expected! Reliable and nice! Totally recommended
15334755;137104978;2017-03-13;114001309;Karen;Sjoerd's place was a great place for my friends and I to stay. It was our first time using an Airbnb and we were happily surprised by what we experienced. The beds were extremely comfortable and the space was nice and clean. There are two balconies and we were surprised by how close the apartment is to a canal. The only issues we had were getting the oven to work, since it was not like those we use in the US and the dirty dishes in the dishwasher, which were easily taken care of. It was close to a grocery store and public transportation which was great!
4001155;99554507;2016-09-05;85519965;Emily;The apartment was very nice and the host was able to kindly adjust the meeting time with our shifting flight schedule. It seems like this is normally the owner's full time apartment, so there were little clues to that around the apartment. It did not interfere with our stay in any way, it only surprised me as I haven't seen that at the other two Airbnbs that I've rented the whole place from. Overall, a great stay.
3027187;37800016;2015-07-10;6209020;Adam;"This is the best neighborhood in Amsterdam. Lots of things to do for kids and adults alije. 
The house is beautiful and was way above our rxpectationd. The kids loved all the toys. 
Jeannine was easy to communicate with and answered all queries very quickly.  Highly recommended"
3027187;47961333;2015-09-22;34712701;Onnie;Jeanine's beautiful home was a home away from home for us.  We are a family of 6 with 4 children aged 1, 3, 4 & 8.  We stayed for 4 days.  The house was perfectly equipped for our needs, especially given the use of the 'Bakfiet' bike, this was a highlight for the kids.  Jeannie was the perfect host and I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending her home to friends and family.  We have family living in Amsterdam and we will be contacting Jeanine for her hospitality again.  Thank you so much.  The Shearer Family (Dubai)
3027187;81084047;2016-06-20;43526307;Melina;Lovely stay. The house is beautiful and in a fantastic location very close to the park and some cute cafés.  Perfect for a family with young children. Jeannine  left some nice goodies on our arrival that made us and our kids feel very welcome.  We also used the bikes a couple of times which was a lot of fun.
9745285;126729566;2017-01-14;28756427;Alexander;The flat is spacious and clean, with a nice kitchen and washroom. Comfortable sofa and bed. Lively neighbourhood with all the essential shops and conveniences - easy access to trams and the rest of the city within short distances. Highly recommended.

Bas et Judith sont tres accueillants,  une bouteille de vin nous attendait à notre arrivée.
Situé dans un quartier calme, mais proche des bars et du centre ville.
Nous avions, dans le logement. des plans de ville/bus pour nous permettre de nous familiariser avec la ville.
Nous avons vraiment aimé ce logement pour une premiere reservation avec airbnb."
1677156;46137743;2015-09-08;35942418;Lisa;We had an excellent experience! We met with Judith on the day of our arrival and she was very kind and helpful. She provided us with all the necessary information for the apartment as well as the surrounding area. She also left us a bottle of wine, coffee, and chocolates. The apartment is very clean, spacious and had all the amenities that we needed for a 10 day stay. It is within walking distance to all public transportation as well as grocery store, bars, restaurants and the famous Albert Cuyp Street Market. We enjoyed our days exploring Amsterdam and it felt like home when we came back to the apartment in the evening. When it was time for us to check out, Judith was kind enough to make taxi reservations for us and meet us to say goodbye. We highly recommend this apartment! We would definitely like to stay here again.
1677156;52843120;2015-11-02;29055184;Dilara;"We have just had a fabulous 5 nights stay in Bas and Judith's great home! Good for 4 people. The home's location in perfect. Close to everywhere and the neighborhood is so cool. You can drink your morning coffee in a minute walk on the canal.

We didn't see Bas and Judith first day. We meet Judith our last day. But they welcomed us with wine and chocolates and had many tips about restaurants, shops and locations. 

If we will go to Amsterdam again, we would definitely like to stay Bas' and Judiths apartment again."

1677156;74038538;2016-05-12;49198428;Linda;This apartment was wonderful. After a long day of travel, there was a soothing ambiance about it that was more than welcomed. A bottle of wine and a lovely private outdoor garden space was  a wonderful way to relax and enjoy being there. Everything we needed was provided and there was a wide variety of maps, brochures and other information that made our stay easier.  Instructions for using the appliances in English (our language) was extremely useful. You could tell that they were experienced travelers who know what information was important. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
1677156;74635508;2016-05-16;59489013;Axel;"We had a wonderful stay at this beatiful appartement! It is gorgeously decorated and perfectly equipped, the garden is lovely and the neighborhood is great with nice shops and cafés just around the corner.
Judith&Bas were very welcoming and helpful, we were greeted with a bottle of wine, cold beers and many tips for the neighborhood and Amsterdam in general.
Again, thanks so much, it was just perfect!"
6683909;54129893;2015-11-16;45711947;Mirjam;Prima kamer met eigen toilet en badkamer in een gezellige buurt. Mariette ontvangt je heel hartelijk en je voelt je er direct thuis. Heerlijk dat je zelf een kopje thee of koffie op he kamer kunt zetten. Bed is prima en kamer en badkamer schoon. Vlakbij Vondelpark en tramhaltes. Een hele fijne plek om Amsterdam in te gaan. Ook s avonds loop je er veilig rond.
6683909;59594345;2016-01-12;26515550;Charlotte;Mariette was an excellent host and it was a lovely room with everything we needed-we'd definitely go back!
6683909;65026483;2016-03-10;2138464;Katy;"My friend and I had a lovely stay at Mariette's place! Bright, clean and well appointed room in a charming and sunny flat. We felt welcomed and at home. Our hosts were low key and available if we needed anything but gave us plenty of space. We ate at Anne & Max's, on the corner, almost daily, because the service was so friendly and the food was -- you could tell by both taste and presentation -- made with love.

Thank you for a pleasant stay! 

I highly recommend this spot to all friends and fellow Airbnb-ers!"
6683909;134467989;2017-02-27;97767504;Nathan;Wonderful room with wonderful hosts. They went above and beyond with amenities. They made us feel very welcomed and were very easy to talk to. Great location for a peaceful and quiet night in but also very close to pubic transportation to get to where you want to be. Definitely recommend
6683909;137044345;2017-03-13;24608720;Rocio;Mariette and Jits have been one of the best hosts we have ever had. Their house is beautiful and even better than the description. They live near the centre (25 mins in public transport and 35-40 mins walking). lovely neighbourhood close to the airport. Communication with them have been so fluid and easy, always there to give some advice and tips. The room is exactly like how was described and so quiet at nights that we could sleep so well. I highly recommend their home and I will stay with them again in my next trip to Amsterdam. thanks for everything :)
4708446;92206006;2016-08-08;11869651;Iza;We had a lovely stay at Claudia's place! The app is situaded in a pleasant area by the river really close to the main train station. We really appreciated the flexibility concerning the 'check-in' /' check-out'. Would definetly recommend Claudia's cozy appartment :)
4708446;96713368;2016-08-24;10246014;Darata;We had an amazing stay in Claudia's place.  The apartment located only few minutes from the ferry going to central station,  so everything was really close.  Apartment is well equipped, cozy and comfortable.

14877672;116166916;2016-11-28;62784818;Celia;Denise ha sido super atenta con nosotros en todo momento. Muy detallista y muy buena comunicación. La casa estaba muy limpia y en perfecto estado. Está a media hora caminando del centro. Pero es una media hora de paseo super agradable por todos los barrios residenciales de Amsterdam junto a sus canales, que también merecen la pena. Muy recomendable todo.
14877672;126881464;2017-01-15;83473534;Laura;We really enjoyed our stay in the apartment. Denise was the perfect host. She made us  feel totally comfortable already befor our stay and even more when we entered the cozy and extremly clean flat. Thanks a lot Denise!
14877672;130200020;2017-02-05;31197683;Dries;Denise's appartment is a tidy and cosy place that's brilliantly located in a hip and trendy part of Amsterdam. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time staying in this quiet and easily accessable neighbourhood. Recommended!
14877672;131468714;2017-02-12;4129131;Aurelien;Denise was a good host, i liked her flat. Was very close to public transport. I recommand Denise for her serious

Thank you Marloes!"
11764928;133669651;2017-02-24;110417650;Roberto;The place was great value. The knifes were sharp (please treat them with respect) and the place was more than enough if you are a solo traveler like myself. I reccomend 100%
11764928;137709305;2017-03-17;67243019;Antonio;"The appartment is decorated with passion and ""joie de vivre""! The balcony is nice, the bed is king size and very confortable. The big view to the sky/public school in front is also unique. The subway and trams to the city center are close. I can only recommend."
13649201;90938377;2016-08-03;29269125;Christa;"Unsere Gastgeber waren nicht in Amsterdam, hatten aber dafür gesorgt, dass wir bei unserer Ankunft sehr freundlich empfangen wurden. Die Kommunikation lief reibungslos, es gab auch keine Probleme während unseres Aufenthalts, wir waren sehr zufrieden.Das Haus liegt in einer sehr schönen ruhigen Wohnstraße am nördlichen Stadtrand, gut zu erreichen mit dem Auto und mit Busverbindungen an die Amsterdamer Innenstadt angeschlossen. Allerdings war der Ijsselmeer-Tunnel wegen sommerlicher Bauarbeiten geschlossen, so dass der Bus nicht direkt zur Central-Station fuhr und wir auch am Sonntag keine Busverbindung hatten. An diesem Tag haben wir unser Auto für einen Ausflug nach Haarlem und ans Meer genutzt. Am Meer ist man in etwas mehr als einer halben Stunde.

Annette hatte eine freundliche Begrüßung mit Blumenstrauß, selbstgemachter Marmelade, einer Begrüßungsflasche Wein, ausführlichem Infomaterial  und einem sehr netten handgeschriebenen Brief an uns vorbereitet. Der Kater war ein netter Mitbewohner!  Von den Nachbarn haben wir nichts mitbekommen. Während unseres Aufenthaltes wurde die Straße vor dem Haus mit neuen Leitungen versehen, was etwas Baulärm verursachte, aber nicht weiter schlimm war. 

Wir haben uns in dem geräumigen Haus sehr wohl gefühlt und können es uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen."
722313;23943243;2014-12-15;22483255;Jack;The apartment was extremely clean and nicely furnished the bed was big and very comfortable. The wet room style shower was also a nice touch. The host was there to meet us on time and was happy to answer any questions. The location is perfect over looking the canals also loads of lovely restaurants less than 5 mins walk. However the studio flat is located above a bar that play music till 3am in the morning it didn't effect my girlfriend but it did me. It was loud enough to clearly hear the vocals.
722313;50742722;2015-10-14;33413916;Christophe;Les échanges avant le voyage et l'accueil ont été tout à fait charmants. Le logement correspond tout à fait à la description, et a comblé nos attentes. Quelques remarques néanmoins, notamment à celles et ceux qui s'attendraient à être en relation avec un particulier : City Centre Retreat est une petite entreprise de location. Très pro.
722313;51263287;2015-10-19;6571197;Christina;"We LOVED the location of this apartment.  There is a super cute cafe downstairs and the friendliest (and most excellent) hairdresser ever next door, who came out to wave goodbye when he saw us come out with our luggage.  You walk out your door to the adorable canals of the Centrum but you are on a kind of side-canal which means there is no noisy traffic.  They did an excellent job of using a small-ish space, with a comfy bed, couch and very large wooden kitchen countertop.  I always worry about fridge noise in studio apartments...not a problem here as it is built into the cupboards!  

We did have some issues with the little amenities that we feel would likely have already been addressed by the resident, had anyone actually tried living there.  It is a very new, newly renovated and professionally managed suite, so I trust that they will take at least some of our list of private suggestions to heart.  Most had to do with bathroom fixtures and kitchen utensils, such as wine glasses.  Also, I am really not sure what is standard for new bathrooms in the Netherlands, but this low-flow toilet (URL HIDDEN) experience.  However I think that anyone travelling around Europe has to be prepared to encounter many bizarre different kinds of toilets, and this was certainly not the worst we encountered!!

That said, I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to recommend this place to a friend and a fully intend to return.  Check in and out were both super easy and very flexible.  And did I mention the killer location?  I loved every single establishment in this neighbourhood and my boyfriend and I had an absolute blast staying in this lovely suite."
722313;56472239;2015-12-14;43389;Guillermo;Location is amazing. Apt is very small but very adequate for one or two people. There is a bar downstairs so nights aren't totally quiet but also not loud enough to be a big problem.
722313;77562837;2016-06-01;38171176;Hélène;L'appartement est fidèle aux photos, lumineux et très mignon, le lit est confortable, l'emplacement est très bien, avec vue sur un des nombreux canaux de la ville dans un quartier sympa. Beaucoup de choses sont faisables à pied et les transports en commun ne sont jamais très loin. Petit bémol, l'appartement se situe juste au dessus d'un café/bar/resto et les fenêtres sont en simple vitrage donc c'est un peu bruyant. Sinon super séjour la ville est magnifique et l'ambiance est très conviviale.
9124288;135536990;2017-03-05;6401746;Shannon;"Judith's place was PERFECT in so many ways! The apartment is beautiful, large windows flood the living space with loads of natural light, the bedroom is located at the back of the apartment and is cozy & quiet. The apartment was super clean and the bed super comfortable. 

The location is outstanding - very close to the bus station with the Schiphol Airport Express bus - which was an easy & cheap way to get to/from the airport.

The special touch of a bottle of wine & some snacks was so much appreciated! We would not hesitate to stay at Judith's place again and are already considering some dates this summer."
8735176;74121037;2016-05-13;14115143;Alexandre;"El apartamento de Joost es impecable, ordenado, completo, incluso lujoso. Todo está en su lugar, todo es limpio.
Además el apartamento es bello, luminoso, bien decorado, confortable.
El acceso al centro de la ciudad es rápido por tranvía y el barrio es agradable.
El único defecto del apartamento es el mezzanine donde está la cama: no es muy alto y la escalera es muy empinada y poco recomendada para personas con dificultades de movilidad.
Sin embargo, la calidad del apartamento supera ampliamente estos inconvenientes. 
Muy recomendado."
12824690;100162485;2016-09-07;37979584;Idan;Comfortable place, quiet, fun with amazing garden :)

Das Zimmer entsprach genau der Beschreibung. Tania ist sehr unkompliziert, hilfsbereit und hat uns direkt bei der Ankunft auf einen Kaffee in ihrer Wohnung eingeladen.
Die Umgebung ist angenehm ruhig, dabei aber sehr gut gelegen."
12427608;80663096;2016-06-19;26425945;Chloé;"Tanja has been a great host. 
She gave us lots of good advice to visit as much as we could during those 2 days in Amsterdam. She was really kind and has been very convenient considering the late time our flight landed.

The room was nice and cosy, exactly how it showed on the photos. 

I highly recommend. 

Chloé"
12427608;82679545;2016-06-28;38390110;Cullen;Tanja is a great host. Very welcoming. Her place was perfect was two people. It's on the forth floor, stairs only. It's one block away from a metro station and around a 20 min walk to Rembrandt Square.
439082;1413716;2012-06-04;2397302;Daniele;"We've spent an amazing weekend in Amsterdam with a few friends. It has been a wounderful experience and I'm sure we'll be back in the future.
The apartment is very nice, cozy and elegant. Our host has been extremelly kind and available and we will refer his place to other friends and people coming to Amsterdam. I hopefully will be back in his place in the future!  :)"
439082;1426809;2012-06-06;2254751;Stephanie;We had a fantastic stay at Fred's! He was there waiting when we arrived, he provided us with museum passes, bikes, guide books and a bottle of wine. The flat is stunning and was perfect. The location was also ideal, situated right on a tram line but also walkable into the main tourist areas. I would definitely recommend!
439082;2101824;2012-08-26;87220;Denis;"Great apartment to stay in Amsterdam, even if for a few days, to get an authentic experience of living like a local, no hotel can provide that. The apartment is pretty much central, in a very nice neighborhood, with all the conveniences and even Airplay speakers in bathroom ;-) Fred was a great host, very helpful and attentive. Can highly recommend:)"
439082;3095563;2012-12-16;3724777;Rianne;The appartment is very comfortable and has everything you need for a weekend but also for a longer period. Fred is a good host and provided a lot of information concerning the appartment and the city.
439082;5362147;2013-06-26;65040;Caroline;Fantastic stay! Fred was helpful, friendly and his apartment is wonderful in a great area that is less touristy than others but still central.
439082;6923809;2013-08-30;8185748;Misa;Fred was a great host!  He was friendly and responsive and the organized instructions and guides he left for us in the apartment were very helpful. We had a couple of hic-ups with the TV and WiFI but he responded to everything super fast and fixed it in no time.  His apartment is charming and in a perfect location - within walking distance to the museums and sites, public transportation, a beautiful park, lots of great bars and restaurants.  If you're looking to experience all that Amsterdam has to offer while also enjoying the local vibe, this is the place!
439082;8962886;2013-11-28;176843;Mike;Fred was a fantastic host - I felt welcomed and well situated upon arrival, museum and tram passes in hand. The museum passes not only got us in everywhere, but when they had just closed the line end of day to the public at Van Gogh Museum, they let us in anyway because we had this. The apartment is spotless, set-up to move in, and looks just like the photos in real life. It's also quite spacious, something I'd certainly consider living in if I was a resident. The location also was excellent - in a very cool neighborhood that's right on the edge of the museum area without feeling in it. Everything you need including a tram to Central Station is 2 blocks away. I highly recommend this experience.
439082;9649861;2014-01-04;1377787;Matthew;Fred's apartment is seriously your home away from home. It has everything - a homey feel, all the things you need to be comfortable. And the real plus is its location in the Pijp - a really quiet but cool area. Supermarkets, eateries and the Albert Cujp market are just there. The Museum section is very close and the Dam is an easy walk (if you are used to walking). There are also two bikes for the authentic Amsterdam experience. Unfortunately, Fred wasn't around to welcome us but Renée was fantastic.
439082;10676568;2014-03-03;8178826;Pat;We have been coming back to Amsterdam on a regular basis for several weeks at a time, and I wouldn't pick another place. It is great here at Fred's apartment in the Pijp and is very convenient to everything. Thanks Fred.
439082;13076443;2014-05-19;8178826;Pat;My family and I had a great time at Fred's place in the Pijp. I love his apartment and want to live there full time!! Fred is great and his place is so homey. Thanks!
439082;16826658;2014-08-03;1122108;Andrew;I stayed in Fred's apartment for 6weeks. It was absolutely perfect. Probably the best apartment I've stayed in with airbnb (and I've stayed at a lot). It's big, very clean, perfectly furnished and has all you could need for a fantastic stay. It comes with 2 museum passes , 2 bikes and 2 travel cards which makes tram travel easy. The location (De Pijp) is vibrant, young and full of restaurants. A perfect place to spend 6 weeks whilst working. Not to mention Fred is a great host as so many others have mentioned. Very communicative - there if anything goes wrong.  Fred is the standard by which all other hosts should live by.
10741538;123225819;2016-12-28;17573471;Mitchell;"Daan's apartment was great. We stayed here over Christmas 2016. The place was warm and cozy, really nicely decorated and had everything we needed for our 1 week stay. The comfy couch and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Chromecast were perfect for days when we wanted to stay inside. 

The apartment is in a great location, there are supermarkets, cafes, bars and restaurants within a 5 minute walk, a bus and tram stop almost at the front door, and plenty of canals and parks nearby to explore. The city centre is about a 30min walk (past nice shops and canals) if you don't have a bike or don't want to use public transport. 

Just a word of warning: This is a typical Dutch house with three flights of steep stairs to the apartment and then bedroom is in the attic and accessed by a ladder from the lounge room. This won't be a problem for most people and it certainly didn't stop us from enjoying the apartment."
2362966;69359539;2016-04-11;65668954;Nilufar Sara;Awesome appartment! We had a great time in amsterdam. It's right next to the city (just 15 min by bike) and Edwin provided us with breakfast and bikes. The apartment is well lit and very cozy. We recommend it and would go there again.
2362966;85196725;2016-07-10;16660271;Ken;"In one word: Lovely !

Lovely home, lovely neighbourhood, lovely host !

Not far from the center of amsterdam (Max 30' by bike + free boat or 20' by bus, bus rides day and night !).

Me and my girlfriend felt so good in your cottage, we even had some beers and some breakfast in the fridge !

Thanks again, and see you soon"
2362966;103532408;2016-09-23;52558237;Frédéric;Place was very neat. All essentials items are provided. Very roomy. It has a nice terrace beside a pond. Location is perfect, 20 min bus to Amsterdam central station.
2362966;113588577;2016-11-13;37449071;Sophia;"Edwin's place was everything that we hoped it would be.  Pictures are very accurate, the view is beautiful to wake up to. Edwin's place is out of center city, however, public transportation is very easy! The bus stop is right across the street and only a 15-20 min bus ride. 
I had the pleasure of meeting both Edwin and his wife, both are very sweet and welcoming. 
Edwin was easily available via text. 
I would absolutely stay again!"
2362966;136214587;2017-03-09;10772865;Valentin Mihai;everything perfect. we would like to come back next year also.
13762373;99208546;2016-09-04;80034860;Saira;Fantastic apartment which is in a great location, the tram stop to get to Centraal Station is accross the road and all attractions are easy to get to from here. Damian is a fantastic host who text us before arrival and gave us lots of tips once we were there. He was very patient for check in although we were late due to a delayed train and getting slightly lost due to a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map mishap! The apartment is very well done with many extras included. We would definitely recommend Damian's apartment and would use again if we returned to Amsterdam.
14157676;99728013;2016-09-05;5789496;Jed;"Unquestionably the best airbnb experience I’ve ever had. 
Certainly, the room is beautiful. The neighbourhood is beautiful. Even ze orchestra iz beautiful.* 
But this listing is really all about the host. You are really lucky if you stay with Shahien. He is incredibly friendly, outgoing, and generous with his hospitality. He knows every detail of Amsterdam. He loves the city, and is delighted to share it with visitors. If this is your first time here, if you don’t know anyone in town, if you are traveling alone, then this is the perfect choice. Shahien is really one of those people who got into airbnb for the social aspect of it. You will leave here having made a new friend, and having seen many of the city’s best sites, both famous and obscure, thanks to him. He made my little 36-hour stopover in Amsterdam into an unforgettable trip that got me hooked on Amsterdam. I’ll be back! 

*if you don’t understand my joke about the orchestra, it’s from the movie Cabaret."
14157676;115136716;2016-11-22;9005804;Alma;I had a wonderful stay. It was the perfect place for me to stay during a business trip because it is really close to the RAI exhibition hall, just a few minutes walk. Shahien rocks. He is a great host and very welcoming to his lovely home. The place is spotless, the bed very comfortable and the room really big. Highly recommended.
14157676;120434165;2016-12-10;7691064;Gaspar;Shahien was the ideal Airbnb host. He was very communicative, friendly, and helpful in getting around Amsterdam. The room/apartment was very nice and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!
1560181;13217910;2014-05-22;14403513;Ying Man;Dan's apartment is wonderful.We love everything in this apartment especially the comfortable beds. The apartment is clean and well (URL HIDDEN) suitables for a family to stay. The apartment is located near Albert Cuyp Market which you can buy nice fresh food . The tram stations are close to the apartment , we found it is so convienient to go to any sightseeing places. Dan is a very nice host . We did have a good time in Amsterdam while staying in his place.
4168426;20874815;2014-10-06;21814633;Kenny;"Stephan was great host.
I came to amsterdam with my girlfriend, our fly delayed and Stephan updated from the internet and wait for us all this time (our phone didnt work).
The apartment great, romantic and small, good for couple.
The place really good. Quiet place, 1 minute from vondelpark, and 10 minutes on walk from leidsplein (less with bike).
There tram station really near the building.

In summary its a great apartment, and Stephan is great host, he really intersted that all ok, and he happy to help."
4168426;34992434;2015-06-14;23903220;Kirsten;"The flat was perfect for us. It is small and has everything you need to stay for a weekend which you plan to spend looking at the city. The location is perfect. We were so happy to stay in this lively neighborhood close to the Vondelpark. Much better and nicer than the citycenter in our opinion. 
Also, the proximity to the airport is fantastic. It took us only 15 min. to get to the flat from the airport by public transportation. 

Stephan was a great host, he accomodated us arriving rather late and leaving rather early. All interaction with him was pleasantly uncomplicated and very welcoming."
4168426;48039355;2015-09-22;6293371;Nicola;"Sthephan place is really very nice and comphortable.
The location, just next to the south-west end of Vondelpark is very convenient to reach the historical centre with a short and pleasant bike ride trough the park. On the other hand, it is conveniently connected to the airport via train and tram.
The building is a very nice and authentic piece of post-war modernist architecture and the flat has everything you will need for your stay. The view from the top floor is amazing. And we got a bottle of Cava wine and sweets as a welcome. Recomended!"
13723769;123395008;2016-12-29;24123853;Helena;A great place - we would recommend it.
3431653;19965100;2014-09-21;16964685;Caroline;"Thanks to Lineke, we could arrive quite late because she managed a meeting with a friend of her for the keys.
The appartement was exactly like in the pictures, even better. Everything was explained on a paper, for the coffee, whasing dishes, etc, and she even prepare some maps and tips for us. 
We saw directly it was a person we can trust. 
The proximity with the city center was good, some minutes by bike. We also had the chance to use Lineke's bike for free, which was such a advantage.
I definitly recommend this flat and feel free to ask some tips to Lineke, she'll answer nicely and really fast.
If I come back to Amsterdam with a friend, I'll rent this flat again, for sure!"
3431653;23242604;2014-11-26;22391106;Guy;Staying at Lineke's apartment was great! From the minute we booked the apartment throughout our stay, she was helpful and kind. The apartment itself is amazing. It is spacious, sunny and warm. It had everything we needed and more - from the hot tub to the Netflix :) The location, like the apartment, is great - there's a metro station just next to the apartment, which makes the city center literally 3 minutes away from you, a supermarket close by, nice pubs and everything you need. All and all, I'd basically want to have an apartment and hosts like these whenever I go on vacation!
3431653;23434964;2014-12-01;22207545;Wannes;"Hele fijne plek in het centrum van Amsterdam! Leuke barren in de buurt en goede verbinding naar de gehele stad. 

Appartement is van alle gemakken voorzien! 

Zou volgende keer zeker weer bij lineke huren!"
3431653;40744921;2015-08-02;13176880;Lisa;What a lovely stay in a lovely apartment! Lineke’s apartment is beautiful, with a lovely balcony where we enjoyed our breakfast each morning. Easy access to public transport, and within walking distance of the city centre. We didn’t have the pleasure of meeting Lineke, but she arranged to have a friend hand over the keys and she provided maps, recommendations and tips. She was easy to get in touch in with, was very helpful and seems like a genuinely lovely person. I highly recommend a stay here – I would return, for sure! Thanks Lineke :)
3431653;66995097;2016-03-26;57314112;Ed;"We arrived at a beautifully presented, warm and welcoming apartment, which the photos on here can't do justice - we were completely blown away by the beauty of and space in the apartment! Lineke and her partner had taken time to leave us some caramel waffles, tourist information leaflets and a very sweet note, welcoming us and giving us all sorts of useful information about the local area and tips for our stay - a really lovely touch.

The apartment itself is incredibly well presented and equipped, with a jacuzzi bath, a Sonos soundbar and smart TV with Netflix, as well as a Nespresso coffee machine, capsules for which were also complimentary. The mattress in the bedroom is easily the most comfortable we have ever slept on and all the seating in the apartment is comfortable, particularly the beautiful sofa!

The location of the apartment is incredibly convenient, with easy access to public transport: this worked really well for us, as we'd never visited Amsterdam before and didn't really have a real feel for the location until we'd arrived (as is often the case with travelling) - it was great to discover how close to everything Lineke's apartment is. Despite it's convenient location, it's in an extremely peaceful residential area.

We had several email exchanges with Lineke, who responded to our queries very quickly and addressed all of our concerns - we literally couldn't have hoped for a better host. We were looking for a nice, relaxing place for a real holiday and everything about the apartment and Linke/her partner facilitated this. We had a truly magical time here and will be recommending it to everybody we know!

If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Amsterdam which will provide you with a beautiful, peaceful base for a genuinely relaxing and enjoyable holiday, we would strongly recommend Lineke as a host and her outstanding flat. We would definitely stay here again!"
1730182;67704597;2016-03-30;4288027;Peter;The appartement was very Nice, clean and cosy as in the pictures. A friend of Werner welcomed us, Werner was very kind and there was a bottle of wine and flowers for ou arrival. The location is perfect as it is close to westerpark and only 20min away from the center. I recommend Werner and it's appartement ! :)
1730182;86258117;2016-07-15;22507593;Wes;"Our stay in Amsterdam was incredible! The apartment was very clean and cozy and located just a short bike ride away from central Amsterdam. The hosts were incredibly kind and helpful. They left the apartment very nice for when we arrived and they left us towels and complementary toiletries along with a list of their favorite places to go and a package of stroop waffles. We visited many of these places and each one worked out perfectly! We highly recommend this listing for anyone interested in visiting Amsterdam. There is a nice super market just down the street along with a bike rental shop near by. Biking is the way to go if you want to stay here! It was a very enjoyable and accessible way to get around town. Lastly, there is a cute garden in the back of the apartment which is perfect for lounging in on a nice day after you've come back from exploring the city. 

Great location, wonderful hosts, and all in all an incredible experience. We will be back!"
664697;3398888;2013-01-22;305282;Andrea;"Alicia was a great host and very accommodating as we booked very last minute. Her communication was excellent with quick replies.

Her apartment is lovely and just like the pictures. The apartment is secure, very homely and boasts lots of modern and new facilities. The apartment is open plan, bright and very spacious. Kitchen facilities are excellent as are shower, Jacuzzi etc. There is a large balcony with seating but we did not really use it due to the adverse weather.  
 
Don’t be put off by the fact that the apartment is on the north side of the river. The free ferry runs every few minutes 24/7 and takes a few minutes to get to Central Station. From Central Station most things are a short distance away on foot.  

Alicia’s neighbourhood is safe, quiet and close to the river side and 5 minutes from the new Eye Museum and Cinema - which is well worth a visit.
 
Thanks again Alicia. We had a lovely time in your apartment and hope to visit again soon."
664697;4022465;2013-04-03;5108198;David;Beautiful space in a terrific location.   The five minute walk to the ferry over to Central Station passes the new film museum, which is always buzzing and is a terrific place to eat.      The apt was clean and well laid out, and the host really made us feel like family when we arrived.    I was traveling with my 11 year old daughter and the location, layout and feel of the place put her immediately at ease and provided a great base for our activities.
664697;4713943;2013-05-21;4235766;Marcus;"Appartement was exactly as described - great location accross the water and nevertheless close to everything in Amsterdam. Checking in and out was a snap (Gracias Carlos!) and even a change of plans was easily accomodated!
Highly recommended!"
664697;43723287;2015-08-21;40044362;Alejandro;Apartamento bastante grande y muy bien equipado. La localización esta muy bien, tienes el ferry que es gratis a 5 minutos andando y te deja en central station. Alicia fue muy simpatica a pesar de que llegamos algo tarde, nos dejó también cosillas para desayunar.
664697;53635032;2015-11-10;30217088;Matthew;"Very close to the town centre of Amsterdam. Just a short hop over the Ij from the train station.

Everything as described in the flat. All in all a nice place to stay when visiting Amsterdam"
664697;68484962;2016-04-05;53468519;Toby;The apartment was nice, great location and a nice balcony. Very friendly host. Only downsides were that the bed was a little uncomfortable and the free parking over 2.5 hours was a short walk away from the apartment.
664697;92873353;2016-08-10;57060203;Jehanne;Alicia's apartment is very modern and comfortable. It is close to Amsterdam (a 2 minute ferry ride and 5 minute walk) but in a very quiet and new neighborhood. She met us after having booked on very short notice, which we very much appreciated. I would definitely go there again!
2755406;24375945;2014-12-27;22904109;Laert;I really enjoyed myself while staying at Jie Chen's nice apartment. The place was and in a very nice location. Jie was very helpful and pleasant. I would highly recommend this place and would be back again If I visit Holland. Thank you Jie.
2755406;68168977;2016-04-02;47458754;Alin;Everything was great! Thank you for a great vacation! The apartment was very clean and full of light!

6259626;33950460;2015-06-02;3958161;Eric;We had a great time staying at Lars's apartment. His place is in a nice neighborhood close to a fabulous indoor eatery/market that we frequented. The apartment is new, bright, modern and has a wonderful outdoor patio. It is also very close to public transit. The onsite laundry was also a bonus and the Internet was lightning fast.
469350;8280987;2013-10-23;8723578;Vera;"The apartment was really nice and the location was great. It is really what you expect when you stay in Amsterdam. 
The area was very quite and it took only 5 minutes to arrive at the lively streets of Haarlem. 
Thank you Carla! We had a really nice stay"
469350;32245391;2015-05-16;556104;Linda;"The apartment was fantastic with a very nice view indeed. It was the perfect place to stay for a holiday in Amsterdam. Walking distance from the train station and close to city center, shops, parks and all that we needed. 

The location was just a stone throw away from everything else, but in a very quiet and tranquil area of Amsterdam. Absolutely perfect in other words!

Carla was a very gracious host and the communication before our arrival was very good. 

This accomodation gets my warmest recommendations!"
469350;35648368;2015-06-21;26657705;Николай;"Great apartment! Carla was a very hospitable host and welcoming. 
Carla helped us with our questions!
10/10 highly recommended!"
469350;37867571;2015-07-11;33867486;Carol;Delightful and private area away from the hubbub of the city, but close enough to get to the action. Carla was a wonderful host in this modern apartment on the top floor with a beautiful view of the quiet canal.
469350;59599064;2016-01-12;47852109;Sam;Great apartment, walking distance to everything, Carla was nice and showed us the apartment and there was a list of numbers and things to do, recommend this defiantly
469350;62408385;2016-02-14;55347115;Liv;Carla's apartment was incredible - such an innovative and well designed space. It was also such an easy walk to everything - would highly recommend staying here!
469350;68091412;2016-04-02;56000703;Wong;It's a place which gives you a special experience with the look out to the canals & staying in a warehouse which was tastefully redesigned as an apartment. However there is no room for privacy.
469350;70211950;2016-04-17;13156814;Amaury;"L'appartement de Carla est très bien, nous étions 5, suffisamment de place pour tout le monde. L'appartement est assez proche du centre (15/20 min à pied), dans un quartier calme. 
Carla a été très réactive pour répondre aux messages et toujours disponible. 
Les photos correspondent bien à la réalité."
469350;79351839;2016-06-12;51183535;Amit;"Bottom line - Carla&Ben have a very nice appartment in a nice and quiet area. But the overall experience can be improved. We were 5 guys in vacation, it was not close enough to the center for us.
Also, we received the appartment not very clean - the window shelf near the beds were dirty and a bit dusty on the food table as well.
The shower is ok, but the head of the shower should be changed - low pressure because of minerals accumulation.
There was barely enough toilet papar for the second day and two drops of soap and no shampoo and no soap for the dishwasher - although in the house details it says there are Essentials.

The house is nice and comfortable - and value for money its in a good location."
469350;107356240;2016-10-10;95468038;Hayden;Good location, nice home. Carla was friendly and gave us tonnes of information on what to go and where to go.
469350;108762705;2016-10-17;50178927;Daniel;Carla was very helpful and accommodating even after we missed our original flight . The apartment was great and as described.
7435471;47191166;2015-09-16;27337662;Nicolas;Vidar's apartment was simply beautifully decorated and located in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, supermarkets (very important detail, they are not easy to find in Amsterdam) and shops. Because of its location we were able to walk everywhere and only used the tran a few times. We couldn't meet Vidar in person but he contacted us the moment we arrived to his apartment, his cleaner Richard was there to help us with the check in, he even sent us a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map with his recommendations for restaurants, bars and discos. Vidar was very professional replying my pre-arrival emails very quickly, he was also very flexible with the check-in and check-out time. Would definitely stay here again.
7435471;95914375;2016-08-21;78561153;Ismael;"La ubicació perfecta, per anar  caminant a tot arreu, barri tranquil i bonic. Amb supermercat a prop, així com amb bars i restaurants a l'abast. Caminar, caminar i caminar.
L'apartament molt ben posat i agradable."
558721;2992944;2012-11-29;4171370;Sonja;"Gil was the perfect host for my first Airbnb experience. He is absolutely reliable when it comes to your arrangements. Also he is very happy to answer all your questions and eagerly trying to make you feel at home. I'm sorry I drank all his tea during the four days. The appartment is quiet and the room is spacious – there are no insects in the room :)
I found it easy to get around, its about a 20 minute walk into the city center, which didnt bother me cause I like to stray. Trams are around the corner though.
I believe its worth getting to know Gil and I'd be happy to meet him again."
558721;3206751;2013-01-01;3941058;Ryan;"Gil was a wonderful host! If I travel back to Amsterdam anytime soon I wouldn't hesitate to book this again. 

It's a quite little room on street level. Feels very private.

Gil is a lovely guy, very helpful and a pleasure to stay with!"
558721;4405417;2013-05-03;5592952;Olly;Gil is a fantastic host - very friendly, helpful and easy going. I felt very relaxed and comfortable during my stay. The flat is in a good area of Amsterdam, close to the centre. The room is very spacious for one and the bed is comfy. It had everything I needed!
558721;4549320;2013-05-12;2640613;Christel;"Staying with Gil was a good experience. He offers a lovely spacious and airy room with a desk in front of the window from where it is easy to use the fast internet connection.
The bed is comfortable and it is easy to get to public transport. There are many coffee shops and restaurants as well as a park in the vicinity.
For affordable accommodation in a convenient location, this is a good place to be!"
558721;6844997;2013-08-27;6371019;Valentina;I had a brilliant stay at Gil's apartment! Gil is a very welcoming  person. He is always ready to help and to give an advice. The room itself is very clean and cozy, and the neighborhood is perfect! Everything is very close, tram stations, beautiful park nearby. I really recommend this apartment!
558721;7720456;2013-09-30;829350;Hubert;"Very nice and very clean place. 
I especially liked Gil's somewhat eclectic collection of books: Robert Ludlum and David Sedaris, Freud and Darwin, and not to forget a Dutch translation of Homer's Ilias and Odyssey ;-)"
558721;8660420;2013-11-11;9311049;George;Gil is an extremely kind guy. Staying at his place felt like home and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Amsterdam. Gil's place is in a very convenient location and even though I did not know the city well, it was very easy to get transportation or even walk to the city centre. Thanks Gil. Thanks Amsterdam. See you soon :-)
558721;11824674;2014-04-16;9360597;Evan;"Gil is a easy-going host and the place is worthy of a single traveller who just want a warm shelter for a couple days stay. Sharing rooms with Gil was a great experience I have never had. He is kind and positive for all the helps that I need. And we shared our career thoughts together since we are in the same industry. Don't forget to bring a pair of flip flops cuz the room is shoes allowed. Or you can just bare your feet if you don't mind.
I definitely like to come back in the future:)"
558721;12822589;2014-05-12;990468;Mathew;A+. Clean, cozy haven from city life. Neighborhood is great and less touristy, but still walkable to the major sights. Gil creates a great energy, warm yet not intrusive, and I hope to have the opportunity to stay with him again. He was even very patient when I had some difficulty working the key late at night.
558721;12944597;2014-05-15;10213079;Megan;The apt was lovely and Gil was a great host, very welcoming and friendly. It's located in a fantastic neighbourhood, very easy to get around and see all the sights. The room was very comfortable and quiet, so great for some much needed rest.
558721;13794018;2014-06-04;15292305;Elena;I had a very nice experience at Gil's place and I really felt at home. The room is very nice and half way between the congress centre and the city centre. If you're attending a conferece at RAI, it's the perfect place.
558721;16313271;2014-07-25;17698534;Marco;Great place, great location. Highly recommend it!
558721;25324388;2015-01-12;24625192;Semih;"Firstly it was a very very good stay. The location of the house is in a very good area, easy to find anything and easy to go everywhere. Also Gil's info makes it easier. The room is perfect (got everything you need and much more) and also having a living room is a good plus too. House is clean and everything was good about it surely.. Living with Gil was so comfortable and he is a great, helpful host. Thanks again for the last coffee Gil. 
To sum; it was a great weekend. If I come back to Amsterdam I'll sure stay here."
558721;28703424;2015-03-29;26470706;Mercedes;Gil was a great host! The room and facilities are large, clean and private. Though we didn't see each other much as I was traveling for business, Gil provided recommendations and responded quickly to all questions. Highly recommend!
558721;28995514;2015-04-02;9079028;Natalia;"Very nice! Clean, big and quiet room. Super close to the centre or the city and walking distance :-))
Loved it!"
558721;40082002;2015-07-28;753782;José;"The room is basically what you expect. Big, quiet and comfortable and clean. The bed could be bigger, but it's enough for one person. GIl is kind always asking if I needed anything. The area is amazing. You can rent a bike around the corner and get everywhere fast. There are great places to eat breakfast,  a market pretty close where you can have haring and nice shops and stuff.
I will definitely stay at Gil again."
558721;47486987;2015-09-19;1618005;Linus;Wonderful host, comfortable place - clean and convenient! Couldn't have asked for more. Would recommend to any single person visiting AMS.
558721;50012314;2015-10-08;11260328;Jordan;Gil was a great host who was very easy to communicate with. I really enjoyed the room and its location in de pijp. It was an easy walk to museumplein and the main canals. I would love to come back and stay here again someday!
558721;52533079;2015-10-30;7841717;Mamen;"Gil house was really cool!! Even the superfanny bathroom ;). The location is perfect, and the room was clean, and warm, and big and perfect! Thank you Gil!"

558721;54111183;2015-11-16;2007866;Joey;This is my second time staying with Gil and I am certain it won't be the last. If you are looking for a place to stay while you are in Amsterdam and you want to live like a local I suggest you stay here. It is a quick tram ride to anywhere in the city or you can rent a bike like I did and bike pretty much anywhere you want to go in about 10 minutes. Thank you Gil for everything once again, it was great to see you my friend.
558721;55136820;2015-11-28;47790153;Kuan;good place, nice host. recommend

The location of the house is very good and quiet with nice restaurants around. It is definitely a nice option when visiting Amsterdam!!
558721;96206544;2016-08-22;3822033;Mariette;Perfect location, not far from eveything such as the Museums, parks, plenty restaurants, cafes, a really nice neighborhood.  I did not have the pleasure of meeting the host but his friends were waiting for me and showed me everything I needed, special thanks by the way, because they are really nice.  Hopefully I will be back soon and I would recommend it to anyone traveling by themselves.
558721;100041723;2016-09-07;12161282;Natalie;"Good size room. Great area. 
Gil wasn't there when I came to stay, his friend was able to help me in. Helpful. 
Upstairs tenants loud with walking above if bothersome and also friend had child getting up early for school. Room is close to the front door entrance if noise sensitive be mindful before booking. Clean washroom. Good shower"

Su casa tiene dos pisos y las habitaciones son mucho mas grande de como aparece en las fotos, es amplia y luminosa, la comunicación es excelente a solo 15 minuto del centro de la ciudad y la plaza Dam  con la línea 14 de tranvía y 20 minutos de la estación central con la línea 21 de tranvía. Muchas gracias Dennis.

7400719;82233157;2016-06-26;75276043;Jordan;Dennis made us feel very welcome, great neighborhood, the room was even better than we expected. Super clean and spacious. He was very helpful during our stay and always willing to answer our questions. We struggled a bit with the public transportation but the neighborhood is only about 15-30 min away from the city depending on if you take the bus or train.
2477880;11724808;2014-04-13;6617713;Christophe;Appartement vraiment sympa, proche du centre. Jan nous a très bien accueillis. Je recommande!
2477880;12279229;2014-04-28;3258865;Françoise;"We had a great time in Amsterdam, visiting the city from Jan's appartment.
Jan welcomed us very warmly, and we had great conversations - he is really open to new people and to discussion.
The room was spacious (on the 4th floor with elevator and flowers on the balcony!), the bathroom is new and very well equipped, the breakfast was great (juice, coffee, tea, croissants, bread, jam, cheese and ham!).
It was KingsDay when we visited Amsterdam (imagine once a year a giant orange party ;-) and despite the loud noise everywhere we could sleep quietly.
The appartment is ideally situated: 10 minutes by bus from the train station (Centraal Station), in the middle of a quiet and heritage district (Jordaan). We could walk every area of the city very easily.
Definitely to recommend if you want to discover Amsterdam or even if you have already been there!"
2477880;18364913;2014-08-25;19611824;Rachel;Was Heel fijn om daar een nachtjete blijven .. Jan is heel vriendelijk , en wou hem bedanken.  Appartement was heel goed gelegen.  Graag kom ik terug.  Mvg
2477880;20028270;2014-09-22;19818158;Zhong;Jan-Tjalling's apartment is situated in a 300 year old conservation shop house, and there's no better way to stay in Amsterdam. Jan-Tjalling was warm and welcoming and taught us much about Amsterdam and its rich history and culture. The apartment is interiorly designed and furnished by the host himself and is highly tasteful and beautiful. A highly recommended stay!

Awesome friendly helpful Host and super clean and stylish Loft!
Best spot to get around town! 
***** i recommend it to everyone that visits Amsterdam *****"
2477880;34893136;2015-06-13;34440666;Andrew;This was my first visit to Amsterdam for 30 years and my first time using airBnB. The flat was easy to find from the central Train station and located in a nice area within walking distance of the city centre and main attractions with good bars and resturants close by. The room was comforable and the flat well presented with everything you need. Best of all Jan was a good host, friendly and helpful as well as providing a good insight into life in Amsterdam. I'd happily visit again
2477880;63503040;2016-02-23;261914;Owen;Jan-Tjallings room is on the 4th floor of a typical Amsterdam canal house. Centrally located on Amsterdam's Brouwersgracht, the place is is quiet, comes with double bed and small desk. Please note, the room is adjacent to the bathroom which you'll shared with possible other guests staying in the other room. You will definitely hear them in the morning. Jan-Tjalling was occupying the main living room for the duration I was there. Communication was quick, key exchange easy organised.
2477880;70482821;2016-04-18;30162154;Cédric;"Very nice and quiet loft with a good location near Jordaan. I recommand  !

2477880;77561802;2016-06-01;57440477;Kelsey;Jan was very accommodating and his room was spacious enough for my two friends and I, and how large luggage. His home is located in a cute and beautiful neighbour that is within walking distance of the city centre -- very convenient! As well, he is surrounded by wonderful cafes with great food. Staying at Jan's made our trip to Amsterdam much more  enjoyable!
2477880;80541104;2016-06-18;22596863;Sven;Wir fanden unseren Aufenthalt in der Loft fantastisch. Es ist sehr zentral gelegen und trotzdem an einem stillen und schönen Örtchen. Jan ist sehr freundlich und weiss eine Menge zu tun. Wir würden diese Loft wieder buchen. :-)
1145866;51963842;2015-10-25;45892317;Emily;The room and apartment were beautiful, clean, and as pictured.  Daniella also has a super awesome shower with lots of fancy buttons and nozzles which was cool.  She is super helpful and had tourist information and directions all laid out for us upon arrival.  Also the bus and tram stops directly in front of her apartment so getting around the city from our room was easy.  Overall a really excellent experience!
1145866;52940802;2015-11-02;44097757;Sabine;Wij hebben een heerlijk nachtje Amsterdam achter de rug mede dankzij de gastvrijheid van Daniella! Fijn dat ze ons bruikbare tips gaf, waar we gretig gebruikvan hebben gemaakt! De kamer was mooi, schoon en ruim! Het complex ligt aan een drukke weg maar het is goed geïsoleerd, je hoort niks van de drukke weg! De badkamer was ook erg netjes! Bedankt Daniella!
1145866;55490928;2015-12-01;46692554;Kristen;This room was great! Very clean, and we got exactly what was shown in pictures. Daniella was very welcoming and gave us suggestions of things to do around amsterdam and very helpful with directions. The apt was only 5-10 minutes outside of the main city attractions and it was very  easy to travel back and forth using public transportation. Loved Amsterdam and loved this listing!! Definitely will be back!
1145866;61328584;2016-02-02;37061968;Liz;We were a group of 3 at Daniella's place, and had a great experience! She was very welcoming and checked in with us before and after our arrival. It was our first time in Amsterdam, and ensured that we had a stress-free trip. The room was very comfortable, and had plenty of space for all of our belongings. Netflix was nice too! The bathroom was especially clean and relaxing! The neighborhood was surrounded by nice shops and restaurants, and convenient for getting into the city center. Would definitely stay here again!
1145866;67535877;2016-03-30;16134067;Aurélien;"L'appartement est située juste à côté du Parking Bos-en-Lommer (très pratique). Daniella nous a laisser déposer nos affaires dans l'appartement dés notre arrivée à midi avant d'aller visiter la ville. Les parties communes et la chambre étaient impeccables et nous y avons très bien dormi. Je recommande cet appartement.
The appartment is situated near the Bos-en-Lommer Park and Ride which is very practical. Daniella let us put our luggages in the appartment right when we arrive around noon and the nwe visited the city. The common parts and the room were perfectly clean and we slept very well. You should try this appartment."
1145866;78870971;2016-06-09;10420771;Hangun;"I stayed 3 nights at Daniella's place. I can say that I will stay at her apartment again if I revisit Amsterdam. 
It was Perfect place."

Well located 
Amazing bathroom
Really helpful host"
1145866;131216558;2017-02-11;114570597;Taryn;She was full of a lot of useful information. She made going to her apartment easy, sent step by step directions on how to get to her apartment.
5614235;33386149;2015-05-27;31010274;Jack Magnus;Monty (real name Des) was a helpful, laid back host and lent us some bikes to use during our time in the Dam. The boat was very cool, better than the pictures might suggest and it was easy and free to get into the centre of town. The area the boat is in might not be the most warming but for two lads it was great. A good experience. Cheers Monty
5614235;39925986;2015-07-27;33041964;Vincent;Monty est un hôte particulièrement gentil. En cas de besoin, il n'hésitera pas à vous venir en aide peut importe la demande. De Slaak est un petit bateau charmant et très attachant où la vie au bord de l'eau est magique. Le Nord d'Amsterdam est calme et parfait pour se reposer dans la nature. De Slaak est un séjour parfait pour un couple mais peut également convenir à plusieurs personnes voulant faire des économies.
5614235;45386129;2015-09-02;38320617;Sara;We throughly enjoyed our stay on De Slak. It's central location and scenic surroundings provided us with an authentic stay in the heart of Amsterdam. De Slak is beautifully positioned with only a short walk to the core of the city, along a peaceful canal. Monty was very helpful with any requests and questions we had.
5614235;67146287;2016-03-27;38660759;Victoire;"Petit passage expresse à Amsterdam , nous avons eu quelques galères afin de trouver le bateau , le manque d'électricité et de salle de bain fut un peu éprouvant mais était mentionné dans l'annonce.
Néanmoins si vous êtes portés camping je vous recommande monty , il a été joignable facilement et nous a bien guidé pour aborder notre soirée au mieux.
Je regrette simplement de ne pas l'avoir rencontré."
5614235;68760499;2016-04-06;59453108;Yunwen;The boat is unique and we have a special experience together in it, although it has no shower and no electricity, it's worth one night. It was a pity that we didn't know how to use the heater, but we could ask the neighbors to help. Monty and his friends are enthusiastic. Recommend!
5614235;73044388;2016-05-06;47703151;Raphaële;"Monty nous a bien accueilli et le logement était tel que nous l'espérions. L'environnement du bateau n'est pas très beau car il est situé dans une zone artisanale et des détritus flottaient sur le canal aux alentours ; mais ce n'est pas la faute de Monty !"
5614235;83886990;2016-07-04;4487782;Syphax;"The boat is not located at the place where the picture of the description are taken. The pictures are taken just near the ferry, while the boat is 20 minute away from there.
The rain come inside the boat. You have to put your food in a box to avoid vermins.
In the description, it is written: bedding is supplied. In reality, there is no bedding (no blankets or sheets). You ll be charged 10 € to have sheets.
The boat is located in an industrial area. There is nothing around. The description mentions places near by with electricity to recharge your phone. It is not true, you have to walk at least 25 minutes to find a place.
It is really overpriced, as the boat is so far away from the city centre. The description is true about the localization of the boat, but the pictures are not taken where the boat is actually located"
5614235;84171577;2016-07-05;27179998;Florian;Monty was really nice! The night on the boat was fun, it was an awesome experience! We just regret that there weren't sheets available.
5614235;89639677;2016-07-29;39157865;Angi;"Basic accomodation as described in the (URL HIDDEN) surroundings are not as the pictures suggest.Rubbish bin was full and there was work-equipment blocking parts of rear deck, the toilet had previous users shit unflushed in it and we had half a roll of toilet paper left...Matress and pillows are well pre-used but ok if you cover it with your own bedding.roof leaked a bit unfortunatly right above the bed but luckily we only had a little bit of rain and the bed didnt get too wet.I know its a boat and ""wildlife"" can get in easy but some spiderwebs looked well established-even though spiders are your friend against mosquitos"
5614235;94979609;2016-08-17;76876284;Sandra;It was a great experience. We had a lot of fun there. The boat was nice an monty is a great host. We don't need more than 15 minutes to get to the city. Bus station and stores to buy some things are around. A really nice place to stay in Amsterdam

It's easy to get to best tourist places like SMK, Rosenborg, the Lakes and even in walking distance to Nøreport, where you can take metro and train in every direction. 
Great place to stay!"

3337356;87781789;2016-07-21;25647997;Bente;The host was very helpful, and we could ask her about practical stuff about the house any time during our stay. The house was very charming, with lots of stairs and rather confusing light-switches, and a wonderful little garden. We stayed there for 10 days, and it was very practical and comfortable for a family of five. We rented bicycles at Svanemøllen sykler, which we highly recommend. Very good service! The house is in a very good and quiet location, five minutes to the train, trains running all the time, ten minutes to a very nice, big park, and the other direction, to the beach. We would definitely consider staying here again.
14101197;101165429;2016-09-12;89402649;Chul Young;"Everything was clean well atranged.
Also the place is perfect, exactly in the center of downtown but it is very quiet.

Sehr gute Lage, um von dort direkt per Metro zu starten oder auch mit dem Auto in die Stadt zu fahren. Gute Einkaufsmöglichkeiten inkl. Einkaufszentrum um die Ecke, nette Restaurants und Take-aways, falls man nicht kochen möchte - was in der sehr guten Küche allerdings kein Problem wäre.
Vielen Dank an den/die Gastgeber!"
2587945;21627415;2014-10-20;22336503;Katrin;"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in der der Wohnung von Thomas und seiner Familie! Die Wohnung bietet viel Platz und ist schön und liebevoll eingerichtet. Trotz dem Lage an einer großen Straße ist sie ruhig, wir haben wunderbar geschlafen. Der Stadtteil Österbro ist recht ruhig, mit Fahrrad oder S-Bahn ist man schnell in anderen spannenden Stadtteilen. Für Familien mit ein oder zwei Kindern ist die Wohnung ideal, unser Sohn hat das Kinderzimmer gleich in Beschlag genommen.
Die Absprache mit Thomas vorab waren sehr freundlich und unkompliziert.
Alles in allem hat uns in der Wohnung nichts gefehlt und wir haben die Woche trotz des Dauerregens sehr genossen."

She is a very lovely person and was so kind to wait for us to arrive. On the way to her place we got lost but she called us and waited for our arrival! Also while we were in copenhagen, we could call or text her for informations or tips to go out. Everything was just perfect!"
3452268;23746878;2014-12-09;22270574;Georgia;Caroline was such a great host - she left us a bottle of wine for when we arrived, her room was clean and cosy, and it was so easy to travel by bus into Central Copenhagen. The kitchen was available to use for cooking (which we did), with tea and coffee and a shelf in the fridge left for us. She also bought us body wash and toothpaste, which was thoughtful! It was the perfect apartment for a couple having a long weekend in the city. She also left a pack of maps, transport timetables and recommendations which was really useful. Thanks so much Caroline!

7585607;79472119;2016-06-12;15668037;Lies;Simon was the perfect host for our weekend in Kopenhagen. The flat was ideally located, just 10-15 mins walking from the centre of town. The flat is just lovely and accommodating. He left us a guide to town, some tips for food and drink places to go. Although Simon wasn't there his neighbour and friend was there to welcome us and show us around! Top location, top flat, top host!
15785447;134792638;2017-03-01;63200998;Sibilla;I stayed at Angelo's home for eight night in February.

325195;78406823;2016-06-06;11545491;Karla;"Frederic hat einen riesigen Beitrag zu unserem Wochende in Kopenhagen geleistet: in einem Stadtplan hat er alles Schöne und Spannende markiert, was Abseits der Touristen-Ecken liegt (von Hipster-Ecken über Ethno-Straßen bis hin zu im Hafengebiet liegende Partystrände). Und wahrlich: gewappnet mit einer wild bemalten Karte haben wir tolle Ecken erkundet in denen man viel Dänisch hört und wenig Touris sieht. 
Von einer wunderbaren Stadt mal abgesehen, ist Frederic ein toller Gastgeber gewesen. Das Zimmer und die Wohnung absolut fabelhaft - ""Schöner Wohnen"" lässt grüßen."

We arrived late in the evening, yet they stayed awake to welcome us and show us the rooms. As we travelled with a little baby they put an extra mattress and made everything as convenient as possible. Other than that everything was just as it is presented in the photos and the neighborhood was really nice. Thank you again!
1618579;48407033;2015-09-26;40848499;Anne;Suzanne a répondu aux messages très rapidement et s'est montrée disponible à l'heure de notre arrivée. Elle a répondu à nos questions, a imprimé nos cartes d'embarquement pour le retour et nous a laissé l'appartement plus longtemps que prévu (11 heures le matin) jusqu'à notre départ en soirée parce qu'il était libre.
1618579;60703410;2016-01-26;10093019;Linda;"Susanne is a lovely hostess with a lovely, cozy house. She greets you with a smile and you immediately feel home.
Her place, on top of their very house, feels like home away from home, and is really just like you see it in the pictures.
We arrived in a cold cold afternoon, we got in and everything was clean and warm, Susanne explained quickly a few house rules and soon left us our privacy.
The apartment is on top floor of Susanne and Steven house, so you basically have all the third floor for you.
Though the house is the same, you will have all the privacy you need.
The kitchen in essential, but perfect for a snack, actually there is no oven.
The location is superb, the area seems to have come out right from a Harry Potter's Novel.
The Norreport Station is 10 minutes away by foot, or 2 bus stops away (the bus is at the end of Susanne's street).
Highly recommended, we will be back soon."
1618579;71324156;2016-04-24;12322039;Andrew;Great apartment in a wonderful area, very close to restaurants/bars/beautiful cycling routes etc. First visit to Copenhagen and loved it. Brilliant hosts, was very accommodating even when our flight came in later than expected.
1618579;71985036;2016-04-30;11624098;Amelie;"Merci Suzanne, everything were alright With you a D thé flamme upstairs. 
We love our  staying at Copenhague. 2 days is ok, even if quite short !"
1618579;101174975;2016-09-12;22469652;Lucy;"A wonderful apartment in a wonderful location. A great place to enjoy the wonder that is Copenhagen. Susanne was very helpful through the booking and when we were at the apartment. 
I highly recommend staying here."
1618579;140882812;2017-04-01;110435771;Becky;We loved the location & comfy feel of Susanne's place. It was only a 5 minute walk to nearby restaurants & a couple small groceries. Even though the bus stop was right at the end of the lane, we walked everywhere. It took about 15 minutes to walk to Nørreport Station for a quick 10 minute ride to airport or out to Carlsberg Brewery. Only a 10 minute walk to Rosenborg Castle & Botanical Garden, 20 minutes to Amalienborg Palace, Round Tower & Nyhavn, 30 minutes to City Hall (Radhus), 35 minutes to Christianshavn. All easy walks.  We set out every morning & often didn't return until late at night. The kitchen is not really equipped for making a full meal, but was fine for tea & coffee in the morning or other low-prep small meals. The balcony was warm & sunny even in March & was a great spot for wine & cheese, & people watching! A great spot to just sit & listen to the Danish language wafting on the air. We loved the feeling that we were living like the locals  & felt that it was a truly authentic experience. For people who are considering Susanne's Place but wonder about traipsing through the first 2 floors of their home, it was a pretty private staircase, & Susanne & her family were totally respectful of our privacy. So very glad we chose this particular rental.
1618579;158901672;2017-06-09;115529606;Bettina;Sehr gutes Quartier. Die Beschreibung entspricht der Wohnung. Es sind alle Dinge für einen Aufenthalt vorhanden. Die Gastgeberin ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. Zentrale Lage in ruhiger Nebenstraße, öffentliche Verkehrsmittel in Reichweite.
3228805;28045841;2015-03-16;22199564;Mark;Great location in the centre of Copenhagen. In walking distance of everything, including the train station. The flat is clean, smart and comfortable. Friendly host.
15472818;116184370;2016-11-28;27230274;Nina;Inga and Eduardo are the best hosts in Kopenhagen. We had a wonderful stay in this cozy, clean and perfectly located apartment. The room is really close to public transportation and  cute cafes and bars are nearby. Perfect stay!
2418463;13816461;2014-06-05;13899754;Fanny;Sara was very kind and available ! Her apartment was very charming, sunny, clean and calm. Easily accessible by bus and the center isn't far by bike. I had pleasant stay and if I come back one day to Copenhagen, I will not hesitate to contact Sara again ! :)
2418463;18288892;2014-08-24;19222926;Mikhail;Nice, cheap, easy. Good place, good price.
2418463;35242904;2015-06-16;26730788;Ellie;This was a great little apartment in a fantastic location (located in a cool neighbourhood about a 10 minute cycle outside the centre), Sara left it very clean for us and was very helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Copenhagen
5491601;39933453;2015-07-27;30825754;David;The apartment was really nice and spacious. We enjoyed the location as it was close to everything but still nice and quiet. Check-in worked smoothly and we didn't experience any problems. We got two sets of keys which was perfect for us since we were two couples traveling together. We can definitely recommend this place!
5491601;86377335;2016-07-16;56354897;Patrick;I'm so glad we stayed here as we had a bad experience staying at the airport hotel when we first arrived in Copenhagen.  We stayed here two days after a Baltic cruise and the location was great and convenient to shopping, bike rental, subway/train and there was a nice park with a playground for the kids just down the street.  Be aware there is some street noise from a pizzeria across the intersection but we closed the windows and had no problem.  Be prepared to lug your bags up several flights of stairs.   Frederik was a very kind host.
5491601;90259476;2016-07-31;66281878;Katharina;"This was my first experience with airbnb and it went really well. Even though we didn't meet Frederik in person (short-time business trip) the communication through the whole process went smoothly - Frederik always responded quickly and friendly and helped us in every way he could.
The apartment itself is in a great location - bars, restaurants, a supermarket and the metro are all located within a (max) 5 min walk and it is perfectly located to start sightseeing.
The furnishing is as described and the overall cleanliness is ok.
I would definitely recommend Frederiks place!"
5491601;93609697;2016-08-13;13703123;Ofer;"We had a great time at Frederik's apartment. It is well located, clean and quite spacious (we were a couple with 2 small kids and had no problem fitting in). The only downside is having to walk the 4 floors up but that's not a real issue. 

We didn't really meet Frederik but he was responsive in email and texting and we had no communication problems. 

We would gladly stay there again. A great option for a vacation spot in Copenhagen. 

Thanks Frederik!"
5491601;98817636;2016-09-02;88861452;William;This was my first experience with airbnb and everything went smoothly.  We’re a family of four with two teenagers visiting Copenhagen for the first time.  Didn’t get to meet Frederik in person but that was no problem as Frederik gave clear and comprehensive communications on checking in and out and was always responsive and polite in answering queries.  The apartment was as described apart from a few minor repairs to furniture needed, reasonably clean, had pleasant street views from the third floor, and was very conveniently located for exploring all the city centre attractions.  We had a great time staying there.
5491601;111385546;2016-10-31;28612453;Vincent;Appartement bien placé, proche des transports. Quartier agréable. Prestations de l'appartement correctes mais pas au niveau que laisse entendre l'annonce.
5586646;59150865;2016-01-07;22810651;Carolin;We had a wonderful time in Sine's nice and spacious flat, just perfect for two. She welcomed us warmly and gave top recommendations for Restaurants: (When you stay here, you should definetely go for dinner at Oysters & Grill, just a few minutes walk away. Excellent seafood in a relaxed atmosphere!). We would definetely recommend Sine's flat.
5586646;62160154;2016-02-12;8156761;Anna;Der Aufenthalt bei Sine war super. Sie war jederzeit erreichbar und sehr flexibel. Die Wohnung war sauber und für 2 Personen ausreichend.  Die Gegend ist super zentral, fussläufig ca. 15 min. von der Innenstadt entfernt.  Würde jederzeit wieder bei ihr einkehren.  Danke
7508712;52617502;2015-10-31;8089174;Barbara;"Marie is an amzing and generous host who made me feel very included and welcome. I stayed in the apartment for 10 days with Marie and her little sweet 5 year old daughter, having my own large bedroom and access to the rest of the spacious apartment. The place has huge windows allowing for the sun to lighten up the entire apartment. Marie has a wonderfully flexible and relaxing attitude; there was a fine balance of me having the place to myself some of the time, and enjoying the company of Marie and her daughter for the remaining time.

Sluseholmen in Copenhagen is a fantastic area inspired by the city of Amsterdam. The area has a maritime atmosphere being surrounded by the water and in addition it is located very close to downtown Copenhagen."
9883119;73062775;2016-05-06;23654951;Pamela;Watson's place was great! Even better than the photos — large room with plenty of privacy and a nice balcony. I would definitely recommend staying here.
9883119;97892711;2016-08-28;32262816;Lucy R H;Watson was very friendly and helpful with everything I needed and the apartment was beautifully new and minimally decorated. Having access to the balcony was brilliant and the shower was the best I've ever used! I enjoyed my stay very much but do be aware you have to climb 92 stairs to get to the apartment! Thanks Watson.
9883119;98507455;2016-08-31;68529611;James;Had a really nice stay here for a few days to explore the city. Great location for a pleasant walk into the city centre and a direct metro to the airport nearby. Watson was welcoming and friendly. Looking forward to planning another trip to Copenhagen.
9883119;121004903;2016-12-13;104436508;Nicolai;Clean and spacious room. Tv and large table with multiple chairs in case you need to hang out in the room or do some work. Great communication with Watson. Recommendable.
9883119;157273749;2017-06-03;30386589;Han;Very kind host and the room is much nicer that I thought before. Clean and spacious enough, especially u can have a top-down view from the balcony besides. It's also very easy to take buses to the city center.
16922617;129757423;2017-02-02;65878074;Emily;Simone's place is beautiful and comfortable.  She was great to communicate with and everything was really lovely.
11675664;77322796;2016-05-31;18873382;Anto;La stanza è arredata con il gusto tipico dei danesi e si trova in un contesto meraviglioso. È anche possibile fare colazione o mangiare nel cortile privato. La casa rispecchia perfettamente quanto scritto da Mette. Sia lei che Cecile (la sua coinquilina) sono gentilissime e pratiche.. La casa è a 2 km dal centro e vicino al cimitero/ parco assistenz  Kierkegaard e in una traversa della via norrebrogade costellata di negozietti e locali. Consiglio a tutti questa casa. Aggiunge poesia ad una città splendida. Noi abbiamo anche affittato una bici vicino casa a pochissimo. Weekend perfetto
11675664;91681044;2016-08-06;7055258;Christian A.;Die Lage in Nørrebro war sehr interessant und gut, um Kopenhagen zu besuchen. Mette hat eine nette, kleine Wohnung, in der wir uns gleich zu Hause gefühlt haben. Alles war sauber und persönlich eingerichtet, so dass wir die Wohnung sehr gern weiter empfehlen.
11675664;94229382;2016-08-15;27765552;Waltrui;Unfortunately, Mette was not in town when we stayed at her nice appartment, but a friend of hers welcomed us with open arms. The room is quite large and nicely decorated, but the wc/bathroom felt rather narrow. Overall, we had a lovely stay here!
17761850;155563553;2017-05-28;127024519;Ricarda;It was a pleasure to stay at Anne Sofie and Christian's place. They were such nice and sociable hosts, who shared these important details that helped making my time in Copenhagen special. The room is lovely and quiet, facing the backyard and the location is simply perfect. From there it is so easy to explore the city on foot, bike or with public transport. I'd recommend it to everyone!
2720514;14612034;2014-06-23;2049639;Derek;"The location is perfect. A one minute walk from the station, yet somehow also very quiet inside. Right down the street there are nice cafe's and grocery stores, and slightly further even more hip shops, coffee bar's, and restaurants.  Also very close to Indre By, the city center with all the old tourist attractions.  The location is perfect for hopping around to other locations, also, as it is close to the trains, metro, and bus junction of the station.

Tomas' place was really nice.  It's a spacious apartment, plenty of room, with all the amenities you need.  Very clean, well taken care of, and everything works.  It also feels very safe.

Tomas also had very good communication with us, responding to questions in advance of booking, as well as to us arriving later than expected.  He also gave us some information about the area and left us maps.

And of course, Copenhagen itself is a great city!  I wish we could have stayed longer. :)"
2720514;159642752;2017-06-11;48691319;Anastasia;The apt was perfect, in a great location: just next to central station (easy for arrival/departure), and right by the meatpacking district (short walk to go out). Thomas was a fantastic host. Highly recommend!
16453676;152115391;2017-05-15;20447164;Maria;Bij het boeken had ik niet in de gaten dat het alleen een kamer met drie bedden is en een badkamer. Badkamer is modern en prima. Bedden slapen lekker en een fijn hoofdkussen. Jammer is alleen dat er een tv is maar die heeft alleen netflix en dat er verder geen tafel en stoelen is dus je moet de hele tijd op je bed hangen. En omdat er alleen een paar glazen, mokken en waterkoker zijn maar geen borden en bestek kun je niet ontbijten op je kamer en moet je voor alles de deur uit. Er zijn wel twee kleine koelkastjes. omdat je aan de achterkant van een gebouw zit is het er rustig. Ik vraag me alleen af waar je moet blijven als er brand uitbreekt in het trappenhuis. Je kunt geen kant uit. Locatie is wel weer perfect.

Everything was clean & inviting and bed was comfy.  Lise is a nice host. I would highly recommend to choose this apartment.
673817;80209683;2016-06-16;3511547;Andrew;Great place - location is cool and local. Lise is lovely and to the point. Very relaxed. You are at the end of the apartment and have the bathroom right next to you so no awkward scampering
3539439;20476873;2014-09-29;21139222;Brett;"This was my first time using Airbnb and I booked a 'spare-of-the-moment' trip the night before going to Amsterdam with my girlfriend. 

Stijn was very accommodating, having everything prepared and giving me all the information I needed for a hassle free, pleasant stay.

The apartment was exactly what I was looking for. In a great location, very close to the city centre and at a great price too!

I really enjoyed my stay at Stijn's place and I would defiantly recommend him to any family or friends looking for a weekend away.

Never again will I stay in a hotel after having such a good experience with Airbnb and Stijin. A Top Class place and host!"
15518745;109720322;2016-10-23;83254238;Nathan;Beautiful apartment & a lovely host, I couldn't have asked for more. If I return I would certainly stay there again.

11654845;66824563;2016-03-25;29745229;Ina;"In der wunderschönen Wohnung im Zentrum Amsterdams wurden wir von einer Mitarbeiterin von Iambnb empfangen, die Tim bei der Wohnungsübergabe unterstützen, wenn er nicht in der Stadt ist.  Das Personal von Iambnb war jederzeit für uns erreichbar und konnte Rückfragen schnell beantworten. Auch die Kommunikation vor der Buchung war sehr unkompliziert und freundlich.
Die tolle Lage und die einzigartige Einrichtung der Wohnung sorgen für einen Urlaub, an den man sich gerne erinnert. 
Innerhalb eines fußläufigen Umkreises hat man alles, was man braucht und kann hautnah das Geschehen im Rotlichtviertel erleben. 

Leider hat der Abschluss-Stöpsel der Badewanne gefehlt, weshalb wir dieses Highlight der Wohnung nicht nutzen konnten. Eines der Waschbecken war nicht am Wasser angeschlossen und das Wasser des zweiten Beckens ist leider sehr langsam abgeflossen, sodass man kleinere Pausen beim Wasserfluss machen musste. Auch der Backofen in der Küche hat leider nicht funktioniert - durch die vielen Restaurants und Imbisse war das allerdings kein Problem.

Tim hat in seiner Wohnung alles, was man braucht. Wir kommen gerne wieder!"
11654845;70255561;2016-04-17;59468445;Andy;Great location right in the heart of Amsterdam. Nice and well presented flat and was made to feel very welcome by the management agency

Its location is so convenient that you can either walk everywhere or take the public transport any time you feel tired. The house itself is a piece of art, very well decorated and light-flooded. Since you have your own bathroom, living space and a bedroom with access to the rooftop terrace, you feel like you have rented an apartment inside a house :)
All in all it was very lovely and we would highly recommend Rutger & Valeries space!"

The apartment is exactly as described in the ad, images faithfully reproduce the spaces provided. The room is spacious and comfortable, as well as the living area and bathroom with shower new XL. the apartment is located near the center and at the same time at a quiet neighborhood, the nice thing is that to 50 meters you can find the two tram lines 2 and the 16th who go to the center in 10 minutes.

840628;58606028;2016-01-03;24346957;Sabrina;Fernando's apartment was perfect for our trip in Amsterdam to celebrate the New Year. My boyfriend and I took a coach from Lyon to Amsterdam, and there were some slight delays and the time of our arrival was very close to Fernando's flight... But Fernando was very patient and very reassuring, and he wanted to make sure our check-in was okay before he left. He was so welcoming and everything in the apartment is exactly like the photos. The apartment is very well-located, with trams that has direct lines to the city centre. It is a very peaceful neighbourhood! We kind of got hooked on the delicious kebabs that is just around the corner of the apartment. In anyways, I would highly recommend his apartment if you're in need of a true Amsterdam Airbnb experience!
13827971;101972295;2016-09-16;5582399;Ellen;"We had a wonderful 2-day stay at Thomas' place! The flat was clean and well-decorated -- I really loved his aesthetic and record collection, and he gave us wonderful recommendations for food, places to explore, and jazz clubs to visit. 

It was super easy to access via tram and bus for both the airport and centruum. Thomas is a really nice and cool guy, and I would definitely love to stay here again the next time I'm in Amsterdam!"

Huisje is knus en netjes
zeker een aanrader"
3835253;77283420;2016-05-31;23623716;Claudia;The appartment was as described and made us feel very comfortable. The host explained to us the area, what we could find in the neighborhood, how to get to the city centre, what is nice to see and visit. The neighborhood itself was perfect, not too far from city centre, with cafes and restaurants and shopes nearby, close to Vondelpark.
3835253;103210380;2016-09-21;94395668;Natalie;"Barry was an excellent host and very accommodating and helpful from beginning to end. We loved his apartment and the neighbourhood. The walk in to the city centre (museum district) took about 30 minutes at a leisurely pace. We enjoyed walking home along the canals from Jordaan each night as well. The outlook over a park and canals offered a host of distractions- farm animals and parrots which called to feed on the verandah. 

Overall a very comfortable stay for the 3 of us. A steep staircase up 3 flights with bikes, was made all the more easier thanks to Barry's help on our arrival and the quiet area and apt was definitely worth the effort."

10593646;99557024;2016-09-05;28673363;Anna;We had the most amazing time in Fleur's apartment. It is situated in a very hip and lively quarter of Amsterdam and really close to the center. You can easily walk there or rent a bike, which we definitely find a great thing to do to discover Amsterdam! The apartment is absolutely wonderful! It is equipped with everything one needs and we felt comfortable there from the very beginning. The bedroom is a room apart from the apartment two floors further up, a very nice and cozy room! There are so many cute shops, restaurants and a big supermarket just around the corner, which we found very practical. Fleur was a lovely host. She provided us with all the information and tips we needed. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet her since she was on vacation, but she made sure that her neighbor welcomed us warmly and showed us the apartment. We definitely recommend a stay at Fleur's apartment! We had a blast! :)
10593646;136718944;2017-03-12;116811933;(EMAIL HIDDEN);Fleur was a lovely host. She was easy to get in touch with and greeted me herself in her appartment. It is set in a great neighboorhood in Amsterdam. De Pijp really has a wonderful atmosphere and Fleur's appartment has a great location- close to bars, cafés, restaurants, and yet in a quiet street. Fleur also left books and a list of her favourite places to go and things to do which I found very useful and ended up going to several of the places. The appartment itself is very charming, spacious and calm. Everything was clean and the bathroom was newly renovated. The kitchen comes fully equipped for anything you might want to cook, although I only made breakfast and coffee/tea. I highly recommend a stay in Fleur's appartment for any couple or travelers of up to two.
13719879;104314595;2016-09-26;27060506;Anders;Rogier was there to greet us when we arrived, showed us everything that we should know about the apartment, and even gave us a bottle of wine! His apartment was very clean and spacious, and the location was excellent. Definitely one of the better Airbnb rentals we have stayed in.
5392718;54135450;2015-11-16;13862048;Olivia;We had a very pleasant stay in Jet's cosy and colourful apartment. Jet is a very warm host and made us feel very comfortable in her space. It was fantastic to be in heart of De Pijp.
14464365;101029294;2016-09-11;92862320;Andy;"If you're attending a tradeshow at the RAI forget those overpriced, tiny hotel rooms and stay at Felice's modern apartment, just a five minute walk from Hall 7! 

Everything at the apartment was exactly per the description. Thoughtful touches like a bottle of wine and some delicious Dutch cookies, added to the comfort and charm of the apartment. 

It's not only close to the RAI there are numerous places to grab breakfast on the way and dinner in the neighborhood bars and restaurants. Convenient public transport connects you to the rest of the city. 

I'd highly recommend Felice's apartment if you're ever visiting Amsterdam."
5733071;31329199;2015-05-04;29822944;Sabela;"We spent a great week-end in Amsterdam. The appartment is beautiful just like the photos show, clean and comfortable. Both Janneke and Henk were very kind and avaliable.
I highly recommend this appartment!"
5733071;49641250;2015-10-05;39626798;Nadine;Wir haben ein verlängertes Wochenende bei Janneke verbracht und haben uns wie Zuhause gefühlt. Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und verfügt über alles, was man für ein unvergessliches Wochenende benötigt. Das Zentrum ist mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln oder den zur Verfügung stehenden Fahrrädern schnell erreichbar. Die Gastgeber sind sehr aufmerksam und bei Fragen zu jederzeit für Ihre Gäste da. Wir kommen gerne wieder bei zurück. Vielen Dank für alles.
5733071;50951180;2015-10-16;44454123;Catherine;Un très bon séjour dans cet appartement. On a apprécié le confort et le calme . Merci pour votre accueil et les conseils.
5733071;67481304;2016-03-29;16570075;Camille;"Un séjour plus qu'appréciable dans l'appartement de Janneke. L'appartement est spacieux, lumineux et très propre. Le quartier est calme. Janneke est une hôte agréable, souriante et de très bon conseils concernant Amsterdam. De plus, elle a été très arrangeante concernant notre horaire d'arrivée. 
Le gros plus : les deux vélos inclus dans le prix.
Je recommande donc grandement ce logement.  
Seul bémol,  l'appartement est assez éloigné du centre ville mais il est très facile de s'y rendre par vélo (15 min) ou par transport en commun. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui nous a le plus plu : pouvoir circuler librement à vélo et profiter de ce système encore si rare en France."
5733071;74405663;2016-05-15;53226614;Sam;This was the nicest apartment we stayed in.  The city was amazing, the bikes were amazing, if you dont feel like riding a bike its only a $14 uber to the heart of downtown.  They were the nicest hosts we have ever encountered.  I would stay there again and will recommend to anyone I hear that is going to Amsterdam.  Amazing.

 Elle est aussi très accueillante (petit déjeuner, mise à disposition de documents et renseignements sur la ville, etc).
L'appartement était très beau, très propre, très bien situé."
2125706;33512386;2015-05-29;30967877;Laurr;Our stay at Thijs's apartment was wonderful. His home is very comfortable and offered all of the amenities needed for a stay in the city. The location was great- the neighbourhood was vibrant and it was about a 20 minute walk to the central part of Amsterdam. The apartment is close to transport and there are lots of great cafes and restaurants around. Thijs was a great host and was quick to respond to any questions that we had. He even gave us advice for public transport and recommended restaurants to try. I would totally recommend this place for anyone looking to explore what Amsterdam has to offer.
2125706;41788525;2015-08-09;12089043;Amrei;"We were very happy to stay at Thijs' place! The appartement is located 5mins by bike from the 'Waterlooplein' and about 8mins from the centraal station! 
The appartement is, as you can see on the pictures, very stilish but so comfortable! We had everything we needed and Thijs was a perfect host! He was flexible and arranged everything so that we could enjoy our vacation to the fullest! We will come back for sure!"
2125706;69294281;2016-04-10;436879;Margaret E.;I really loved this apartment: bright, clean and spacious.  The multi ethnic neighborhood is close to tram lines and easy to navigate.  I highly recommend it.
2792893;17689057;2014-08-16;809472;Linda;We had a great time in Amsterdam and the studio made it even better. It was a lovely little place, very quiet for sleeping with a nice view over the rooftops of the city. The studio is in a quite area near to the Vondelpark. It was comfy and clean, with all the comforts we needed including access to Wifi, clean towels and linen, a fridge, plates and dishes, as well as coffee and tea. Thank you Margriet and Wicher for letting us stay! I can only recommend it! :)
2792893;19035948;2014-09-05;3209140;Austin;We had a great stay at Margriet's place on Johannes Verhulstraat. The location is very nice and far enough from the center to feel relaxed yet close enough to get to everywhere you need to by bike. Margriet was very helpful and responsive to our requests.
2792893;70614809;2016-04-19;6783636;Cecilia;"The apartment is located in a residential area close to Vondel park,  15 minute walk from the Van Gogh museum. It is located on the top floor of a typical (and beautiful) house. Really steep stairs! The room was clean, comfortable and equipped of everything. A really pleasant stay!

Wicher and Margriet were really kind and helpful. 
L'appartamento si trova in una zona residenziale vicino al Vondel park e a circa 15 minuti a piedi dal museo Van Gogh. Si tratta di una stanza con bagno privato all'ultimo piano di una palazzina tipica. Scalinata molto ripida per arrivare, ma assolutamente fattibile. La stanza l'abbiamo trovata pulita, equipaggiata di tutto. Abbiamo conosciuto Wicher che ci ha fornito utili indicazioni sia per muoverci, per l'affitto delle bici e ci ha dato suggerimenti per come tornare in aeroporto (partivamo la mattina presto e c'erano pochi mezzi pubblici). Esperienza positiva."
2792893;81155047;2016-06-21;71553570;Selma;"We had a great weekend in Amsterdam in this perfectly located Airbnb! The neighborhood is really quiet and full of small stores and nice restaurants. The apartment was very clean and had a great view from the top floor. Thank you for all the help and suggestions on what to do and where to go in Amsterdam. We will definitely rent this place again in the future! 
Selma and Eduard"
2792893;131033411;2017-02-10;8124015;Sabrina;I loved the studio. It had a great fire in the bedroom which made the room really cosy in the evening. You have your own bathroom and if you want to eat in, you can. Although there's enough restaurants in the neighbourhood. Margriet checked in with me a few times which was very nice. I think I've had the best sleep ever in Amsterdam in this studio. It was so quiet outside. There's also public transit nearby. The only thing which was a bit hard for me was the wifi. As I was on a business trip, in the evening I had to work a bit which was hard as the wifi connection would go on & off. I would definitely stay here again when I go for a leisure trip to Amsterdam. I can imagine in the summer it must be amazing with their sunroof terrace. Thanks for the hospitality!
13353905;111722594;2016-11-01;99698773;Arthika;"Cecilia's house is very beautiful, spacious, clean and comfortable. You have everything you need!
Cecilia is a perfect host, she welcomed us perfectly and gives us a lot of advises. 
I really enjoyed my journey in Amsterdam and can't wait to come back!"
15110844;105549441;2016-10-02;95263166;Michael;Erik as a host is very much concerned about the wellbeing of his guests and I can really recommend to stay with him. He took time to explain the modus operandi of his house to us, provided tea, coffee and cookies for us, showed us where to find extra blankets and gave us hints where to go for shopping and leisure in Amsterdam. He also inspired us with stories and experiences from his life and showed us his artworks. Thank you, Erik!
15110844;114727247;2016-11-20;84881181;Alexia;Erik's place is great for a business trip, or a short trip to explore Amsterdam! It was really easy to use the ferries and access the city. The ferries take you directly to Amsterdam Centraal, which was especially convenient for catching the train to Schiphol. Erik was a very kind and welcoming host. I would certainly recommend it!
15110844;116174909;2016-11-28;103581173;Damien;Nous avons reçu un chaleureux accueil, Erik est un hôte attentionné et ses conseils pour découvrir la vie locale ont été très apprécié. Je recommande son logement charmant et typique au cœur d'un quartier tranquille.
7305938;74711717;2016-05-16;38893339;Francesco;Tout était parfait : l'appartement, le balcon, la localisation à quelques pas du tram, et les conseils de Anne!
7305938;108089319;2016-10-14;54447689;Cadu;"O apartamento da Anne foi um achado! Lugar muito tranquilo e silencioso, com ótimo comércio próximo para suprimentos (supermercado, Organicos, peixaria, loja de aluguel de bicicleta - a que ela nos recomendou foi legal - e até lojas de telefonia (vale comprar um ""sim card"" (chipe) para ter internet 3G), roupas e quebra-galhos.
Fora isso fica próximo ao centro. De Tram (bonde) fica a 15 no máximo. Andando são uns 40, e de bike uns 15.
As dicas que ela nos deu na chegada - um papel já impresso para nós, com lugares para visitar, restaurantes, bares etc. nos ajudou.
Ela foi uma anfitriã muito gentil e nos recebeu com frutas, uma garrafa de vinho branco e croissants... Nada melhor para quem estava vijando a 16 horas...
Fora isso a casa estava muito limpa e arrumada e a cozinha bem completa de utensílios.
Ótima pedida para um casal."
10070776;63377943;2016-02-22;56156345;Inge;"Het appartement was ruim en de eigenaresse gaf ons zeer accuraat de informatie die we nodig hadden voor ons verblijf, zoals de manier waarop we de sleutel kregen en telefoonnummers die nodig zouden kunnen zijn. Ook informatie over parkeren etc. was duidelijk. In het appartement een goede beschrijving van o.a. bezienswaardigheden en restaurants.
Al met al een prima adres!"
6843332;139234497;2017-03-24;95861285;Will;Paco was a very gracious host. His location is walking distance from every attraction in Amsterdam. He allowed us to drop off bags prior to checkin time which made our trip much easier. The kitchen is very usable and allowed our large group to make quick cheap meals. Sharing the common area with Paco was no problem at all, he gave precedent to his guests and was nothing but accommodating. Would recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam.
6843332;140201635;2017-03-28;44169893;Cian;Cool place in a perfect central location. Had a great time! Would recommend!
1829726;9549297;2014-01-02;9073735;Anna;Myrthe is such a nice host. We met her to exchange keys and she provided us with all we needed (including information on the surrounding). The contact was very nice and  reliable too. The apartment is perfect for everyone who is looking for somewhere to stay in Amsterdam. The city is just a short walk away and the neighborhood offers everything you need - supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and also small cafés. We couldn't have had a better time in Amsterdam.
1942699;63807626;2016-02-27;21112166;John;What a great place to stay in the perfect spot! Nil's place was spotless, quiet, comfortable and convenient. It truly felt like a home away from home for us. My wife has a hip condition and uses a cane. Access was perfect for her. It is on the first floor, no stairs, plenty of room and a convenient walk to public transportation. Freek met us and explained everything we needed to know. There is an awesome information booklet about Amsterdam that is very detailed and should be published. Excellent work on everything, gentlemen. We couldn't be happier with our accommodations.
1019936;23646572;2014-12-07;8037092;Rebecca;"My host made us feel extremely welcome. Her apartment is absolutely beautiful, exactly what you see in the pictures she has posted online - except it almost looks even cooler in person. The neighborhood is perfect; quiet and residential for good sleeping conditions, but just a quick walk from anything that you would want to do (including Anne Frank house, just 5 minutes away!). I traveled with in a group of 6, and we are all college students. Lynn was like our adoptive Amsterdam mother for the weekend, giving us tips and trying to help us have a great time. I would definitely recommend her for anyone interested in visiting this beautiful city!"
12057395;113612692;2016-11-13;101192449;Aby;"Super Appartement à 20 minutes de centre d'Amsterdam!
L'appartement est clairement le même que sur les photos voir mieux en vrai.
Je recommande  :) ."
5567622;37492637;2015-07-07;35309755;Isie;We has a great time in this spot, lovely location with great access to the city. We hired bikes at an excellent rate from the end of the road and used these to get in and out of town for our stay. Our host arranged for her dad to meet us... He was lovely! The fridge was stocked and the house a lovely retreat. Many thanks... We'd highly recommend staying here!
13123467;83569740;2016-07-03;255548;Ert;"The flat is ona very nice leafy street, very close to the metro and supermarket and Oostepark. It is exactly as advertised in the pictures, and the balcony is a definite plus. Very clean, spacious rooms, with nice wooden floors. The flat is very nicely decorated and feels very cozy.

The check-in was done by the company taking care of Katelyn's flat, and they were helpful. However, most Amsterdam Airbnbs are managed as such, and I have to say it destroys the personal touch that I have always built with the landlords.

We enjoyed comfy beds after long walks in Amsterdam, and the shower works perfectly too.

The only downside is Katelyn's neighbours are bit sensitive to noise, as they claimed to be disturbed by our footsteps after 10pm (no shoes in the flat), even though there was a loud party happening in the building across the road.

Also, we could not find a pot to cook pasta, so that was a minor downside as well.

All in all I would recommend Katelyn's place, but would have definitely enjoyed more personal connection."

3840161;73521510;2016-05-08;26624552;Kate;Annet made us feel welcome with flexibility with our arrival time, and a nice bottle of wine when we arrived. The neighborhood is charming with good restaurants and cafes in walking distances. The apartment is lovely open, chic, and comfortable. We had a wonderful stay there.

16419717;139372081;2017-03-25;22538522;Emily;"The apartment is great! It's exactly as pictured, plenty of space for a couple of people to stay without feeling on top of each other. Its in the perfect location not too far out of the center and right next to the tram line which runs frequently. There is a supermarket just around the corner which has everything you need, and a lovely restaurant just on the corner that does lovely fresh croissants with homemade jam. We rented bikes which definitely helped see the most of the city, there is a bike rental shop just down the road from the apartment which is very handy. 

Lucie was a great host, she provided lots of great recommendations that helped for our first visit to Amsterdam. I cannot recommend this apartment enough, I will definitely stay here again when I next visit Amsterdam."
14610348;101053200;2016-09-11;68726134;Federico;El lugar tiene una excelente ubicación, muy luminoso y amplio. Esta muy limpio, con una vista muy linda de uno de los bellos canales de Amsterdam de un lado y un increíble balcón del otro, ideal para desayunar. La relación precio calidad es muy buena y la anfitriona Stephanie es muy agradable. El único aspecto que habría que aclarar en la página inicial es que el baño es compartido, que se avisa una vez que lo contratas. Altamente recomendable para pasar una fantástica estadía en una ciudad mágica.
14314114;93317311;2016-08-12;35209054;Davide;The apartment is a nice place to stay for traveling students or young couples. Not the best stay in Amsterdam.
2173348;12376366;2014-04-30;13399363;Joanna;The flat looks like on the pictures, is very spacious and in good style. Perfect for 4 people or even more because the living room is very big. In the apartment there is eveyrthing you will need staying there even for longer. There are many restaurants, shops and cafees around and also the city centre is very close. Rick is very nice and helpfull so we can only recommend this offer to the other people!
2173348;60952459;2016-01-30;391769;Meghan;Rick met me (early!) in the morning to make sure I got the keys, and was available for any questions I had during my month-long stay. The apartment is a great mix of location, style and gezelligheid :-) Definitely recommend it!
463638;108944385;2016-10-18;16546444;Victoria;Mieke's friend, Luiz, met us. He had a basket of bread and cheese, fruits, sweets and a bottle of wine for us. The apartment was lovely and we really liked the location in old Ansterdam.
16611402;132767322;2017-02-19;108922843;Simrin;This apartment is almost perfect! First of all the host, Passion, was so diligent, easy to contact, and kind enough to offer beyond what other Airbnbs do. This place is not central, but it's in a very nice location, super close to bus/tram stations-- about 20 minutes from the center and 15 minutes from the airport. It wasn't a big deal at all. The bed was super comfortable. The apartment is equipped beyond compare with a hotspot for you to access wifi anywhere you go, breakfast foods, some toiletries, a printer, and much much more. I could not have asked for anything better, and the price was amazing. 10/10 recommend!!
16611402;136370779;2017-03-10;70147214;Harper;Passion's apartment was very clean and well put together. The bicycles she gave us were a huge bonus since Amsterdam is 100% a bike city. She even held our bags for us after we had checked out so that we could enjoy our last day in the city before our flight that night. Overall, it was a great experience!
6552244;67481181;2016-03-29;8409799;Moira;Frank, his wife Willy and their housekeeper Rahma made us (4 adults and 2 kids) feel more than welcome. We had a wonderful stay in their bright, spacious and modern house by the water and really appreciated all the amenities put to our disposal, from the espresso machine to the bikes and toys for the kids. Really a perfect choice for families visiting Amsterdam because of the perfect location in a calm and child-friendly area, where you can wind down from the hustle and bustle from the city centre (which can still be reached in less than 15 minutes by tram). Another big advantage is the fact that you can park up to two cars free of charge at the house, as parking in Amsterdam can be very expensive. We just wished we could live here ourselves! :)

When we checked out, I forgot my jacket in their flat and Roderick kindly offered to send it back to me, so I can only say, thank you very much. We enjoyed our stay, and your very cozy, so personal and lovely flat!
14210905;133395183;2017-02-22;2943063;Anish;We had a great time staying at Lianne's apartment. The place was in a perfect location right near the market and centre of town and there were lots of bars and restaurants nearby. However the apartment is on a quiet street so you get a great night's sleep. Lianne was a perfect host - communicated well and was extremely helpful.
7323381;53694422;2015-11-11;46353913;Robert;We were made very welcome. Although we were significantly delayed Joke waited patiently of us, and very enthusiastically gave us a full introduction to the flat. It is in an excellent location, and is well provided with good local restaurants and bars in de Pijp. We definitely recommend it to others.
7323381;76583164;2016-05-28;40031959;Zach;I was unable to meet Pieter, but Joke was a great host. The apartment is minutes away from anything you need in the city. I would highly recommend it as a place to stay in Amsterdam.
7323381;115145890;2016-11-22;52774314;Kristina;"We enjoyed our stay very much.  The apartment was comfortable, nicely decorated, well cared for, and well-equipped with everything that we could have needed.  It has nice big windows overlooking a canal, that take the eye right over the street below.  The windows block noise and we slept well.

Joke, Pieter's mother, was waiting for us to arrive and gave us a thorough tour of the apartment and instructions.  Her daughter lives upstairs should there be an urgent need.  Joke was so thoughtful -- even providing snacks to get us started!  

The location was excellent for accessing all parts of central Amsterdam.  It is just a few minutes walk to the bus to and from the airport, as well as to tram stops to go into downtown areas. That said, the central part of Amsterdam is not far and makes a nice walk or bike ride. I wish we had taken better advantage of the two bicycles provided, but it was rather rainy during our stay.  If only we could have stayed longer!"
12330573;104917594;2016-09-29;86070420;Cosima;The apartment is located in a nice neighbourhood, good to reach and has a shopping centre near by. The apartment itself was cosy and looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The only thing that didn't work was the gas stove, but since that is fixable, the apartment offers a nice and comfortable stay.
10424174;62984844;2016-02-19;15741686;Jason;"Wonderful and stylish apartment in a superb location. Bed is pretty cozy too ;)"
4650761;61254643;2016-02-01;56176066;Evren;"Thanks to Danny for his great hospitality and help in everything. Despite having an accident at home, our journey was amazing, and with his help to my friends, the problem also solved very quickly at the hospital as well. 

Thanks again Danny."
4650761;62451196;2016-02-14;25756330;Michael;Danny was a great host! Even though we arrived a bit late, he was still an excellent host and the house was in perfect shape. He gave us suggestions around the city and even offered to take us to some. I will be sure to see if Danny's houseboat is available again the next time I come to Amsterdam.
4650761;82849419;2016-06-29;33145907;Jax;Danny was an amazing host and the boathouse was beautiful and in such a great location. We had a fantastic holiday and would definitely recommend staying in Danny's boathouse
4650761;122748015;2016-12-25;96634281;Monica;The host canceled this reservation 159 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4650761;132710089;2017-02-19;94648400;Carla;"Had a fantastic time on Danny's house boat it did not disappoint us, it was the first time I had used airbnb but was really easy we called Danny when we arrived he gave us directions to the house boat meet us with the keys showed us how to use everything.  He gave us directions and local transport information which was very helpful the boat had beautiful views over the canal and was lovely and clean the beds were comfortable and considering it was February it was lovely and warm, couldn't have asked for any more. Lovely weekend would return to Amsterdam and to Danny's house boat in a heartbeat. 
Thank you Danny"
4650761;138742927;2017-03-21;9026358;Gherardo;House boat molto carina, molto vicina alla fermata della metro e a un buon ristorante spagnolo. Ottimo il caffè nell hotel vicino alla metro.  Pulita e molto caratteristica, consigliamo vivamente a tutti di soggiornare in questo splendido appartamento cullato dalle piccole onde del canale!
1580233;21670914;2014-10-21;2936562;Abdulwahab;Carina went above and beyond what any host has done for me before. True kindness, and would stretch to her max in order to make sure you are comfortable and happy. I had to extend by my stay and she was able to accommodate me - not only that but she was gracious enough to work on a budget for me which was too kind of her. Thanks again for all. Would I come back? Of course! Location is spot on and flat is huge. Beautiful space.
1580233;98314210;2016-08-30;57944743;Ed;Really really good. Carina was in touch and helpful when needed. The place was clean, modern but cosy at the same time. The area is right on the border of the older center and the newer outer city and is lively and young feeling without too much of a party vibe. It's right next to the top of Rembrandt park which make a cycle in to the middle of town just lovely and in general felt like a clean and safe neighborhood. Perfect for a couple looking for a city get away.
1776018;58649369;2016-01-03;28181741;Andrew;Lot and her partner are delightful hosts. They made us feel immediately at home and supplied lovely local beers and wine as a welcome present for our stay for new year's eve. Their add & photos accurately portray a lovely family home, tastefully and comfortably furnished. Flickering candles throughout their home added further warmth to combat the christmas winter chill outside. The location is on a quiet street with meter-parking outside and a pleasant 15 minutes walk to the centre. The local area has it's own ambience with lovely restaurants, cafes, bars and canal-side walks. Without a doubt, we wouldn't hesitate to contact Lot again if we plan to visit Amsterdam in the future.
15077400;104088883;2016-09-25;94836726;Prescillia;L'appartement était parfait et tres propre conforme à la description, le logement est tres bien situé à 10 minutes du centre avec TRAM. Un tres bonne acceuil ainsi qu'une hote tres gentille. On pense y retournee et on le recommande.
12106511;83898774;2016-07-04;53034306;Mimi;We chose well when we booked this light, clean studio in Amsterdam. The neighborhood is rather industrial with no restaurants or shopping (except for a small grocery store and a McDonald's) but the apartment is just across the street from the Metro station. We were downtown in minutes, and could easily connect with other transit. When we needed a break from sightseeing, we could return to the apartment, catch our breath and be back on our way easily. The studio is comfortable with a double bed, couch, table/desk, kitchen and bathroom. The WiFi worked great. Our host met us at the door minutes after we arrived. We would highly recommend staying here.
12507833;99935577;2016-09-06;92770465;Amelia;Eva and Kobe were great hosts, very helpful and offered to store our luggage when we couldn't get into the apartment until half 3. Apartmemt was lovely in a good location close to the city centre and had nice restaurants nearby.
1784824;20193381;2014-09-25;1403536;Sarah;Annemarie made us feel very welcome in her home. Her apartment is well situated near the city center and in front of a beautiful canal. Close walking distance to Vondelpark (Amsterdam's Golden Gate Park on a smaller scale).
1784824;99770074;2016-09-05;18932945;Jennifer;"The location as others have mentioned is a really great location. Easily walkable to the Tiergarten area. Beautiful views in the day time, and seeing the light reflected on the canal at night was awesome. The apartment itself is very bright and open as pictured. There were a few challenges that have not been mentioned previously that I found really important to share.

The access to the roof garden area is via a ladder in the kitchen. I couldn't actually take advantage of this perk because I'm 7 months pregnant so I have no idea what the roof garden is like.

Visiting in the summer months with high heat, and windows without screens meant lots of mosquitos (or suffering through heat).

The under construction stairs up to the fourth floor were a bit hazardous on the first level. Not something that could be controlled directly, but should be something folks are made aware of prior to selecting the location. 

Check-out time was modified to 10:30am because of the cleaning crew, versus what was listed at 11am. Not a big deal as we ended up
leaving early as I had an allergic reaction to the mosquitos. We ended up staying at the Banks Mansion where they had AC and we could leave the windows closed during the biting times.

I would totally recommend this location during the non-Summer months when the mosquitos are more prevalent (or when you don't have to open the windows for air)."
6828314;43054484;2015-08-17;21609676;Marie;"Ivana and Jules's House is very welcoming (fresh flowers decorating the house), comfy and quiet. You really feel ""at home"". Thank you for letting us stay at yours, we had a wonderful time and the kids enjoyed the fantastic playground in the living room. The house is perfectly located to visit Amsterdam (bus/tram connection). Thanks also for the nice tips on the restaurant in the area :-)"
11094104;67496265;2016-03-29;56095697;Alex;"L'appartement est idéalement placé dans la capitale. À proximité de tous commerces et des rues animées.
De plus l'appartement est situé au pied du tram, il y a un peu de bruit mais ce n'est vraiment pas gênant et c'est très pratique pour circuler."
11094104;68888812;2016-04-07;47017920;Lotte;"Het appartement ziet er precies zo uit als de foto's voorspellen. En recht in het centrum, je bent overal direct. Er is een tram halte voor de deur, wat ideaal is (wij huurden een fiets, wat ook ideaal is :-))
Het was heel gemakkelijk om met Michiel af te spreken hij antwoordde super snel."
11094104;88865204;2016-07-25;37725974;Francesca;Great location. Michiel was incredibly gracious. He met us early for check in and had some great recommendations for things to see around town. I would definitely stay here again when I'm next in Amsterdam.
11094104;111118515;2016-10-30;17543061;Ilona;Stayed at michiel's place for 4 nights. Never met with him but robert was great at checking us in. Will not be repeating other's reviews, but what makes this place a winner is it's location. 5 minutes on foot from practically anywhere!
11094104;128375412;2017-01-24;4904551;Anton;Michiel's place is really cool and cozy. Perfect location in the heart of the city, 1 min to Singel channel, up to 10-15 mins to main city attractions, reasonable price. Trams are not so loud as some guests wrote/we expected. But in case of cold weather (below-zero temperature I mean) be ready to turn on heaters to warm up.
13845367;89459410;2016-07-28;83025080;Hannah;"Olya was very helpful and her apartment has everything it needs! It's in perfect walking distance (about 20 minutes) to the center and the canal with meadows in front of the house is perfect to relax and a lovely view from the living room! Also it was very clean and the bathroom is modern :) 
We felt very welcomed and at home! Description fits perfect :)"
1380875;12606697;2014-05-06;7539283;Colin;Iris's apartment is gorgeous, really well located ( 15 min to city center ) in a very quiet area. Iris provided us with many advices to enjoy our stay. However if you intend to party or make some noise this is definitely not the right place, Iris tolerate no noise.
1380875;22623501;2014-11-10;987459;Marine;Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Iris. Le logement correspondait à nos attentes, nous y avons passé un agréable séjour. Le quartier est bien situé dans Amsterdam et bien desservi par les transports en commun.
1380875;27512528;2015-03-06;16359418;Börkur;"I stayed at Iris' for the second time during a work visit to Amsterdam. The room has an antique feel to it although the bath and the kitchen seem recently renovated. I felt really comfortable there.

Iris is a great host, friendly and the communication is always good."
1380875;31867687;2015-05-11;23250006;Cynthia;"Iris greeted us when we arrived and gave us a great map to tour the city.  She marked several places for us to visit which was very helpful.  The directions to her place from Centraal station were perfect.  

We felt most of the city was within walking distance and what wasn't was easily gotten to by bus or tram.  The tram is just around the corner.  The apartment is also located near a couple of supermarkets and the Albert Cuypmarkt is just a few streets away for some great street food and to purchase anything you may have forgotten to bring with you.

The apartment was a very nice size for 2 people and we had complete privacy, but Iris was just downstairs if we needed anything.  She has a nice assortment of teas in the kitchen for you.  There were plenty of clean towels and everything we needed in the bathroom and kitchen.  Wifi worked well."
1380875;33350171;2015-05-27;25596524;Ronan;Iris made us most welcome, and helped us with navigating the city.  Lovely quirky room in a nice area. Kitchen and bathroom were great and well featured.
1380875;34516229;2015-06-09;6221442;Gitane;"Iris was a great host. She went out and stocked up on things like coffee and filters and chocolate. Nice touches. The room was cozy and comfortable and very quiet. We loved the little veranda and found De Pijp charming with an easy walk or bike to all points of interest.

Thanks for a nice stay, Iris!"
1380875;34716443;2015-06-11;4479832;Dorian;Accueil chaleureux avec des conseils forts utiles. Le gîte est bien situé car à proximité à pied de nombreux centres d'intérêts. Celui-ci à l'avantage d'être lumineux et bien équipé.

1380875;60978735;2016-01-30;13554833;Tiger;I felt immersed in Amsterdam. Iris' acccomodation is very close to the water. The comfortable room has all that you need. Iris offered to help but I felt like finding my own way around this time. Communication was fluid. I can recommend this quaint space. It was perfect for a short amsterdam getaway in winter. Thanks Iris.

The stairs were a bit steep, but we managed. 
Excellent location."

1380875;82678733;2016-06-28;14849749;Ellen;Beautiful apartment in a wonderful neighborhood in Amsterdam. If you want a more local experience, I would recommend staying here. The space had a cool vintage feel with an incredible outside porch. Iris was great and gave us a run down of the city and places to see. She let us know if we needed anything to reach out, but the space had everything we needed!
1380875;84138621;2016-07-05;38184672;Rubens;Amazing stay.
1380875;96242102;2016-08-22;32244348;Marco;Special white painted old wooden walls and ceiling sleeping room. I didn't feel like going out! I haven't had many chances to meet the host , but everything was perfectly organized and tidy. Location also perfect: just outside the crammed city centre in a place  where people seem to live and not just make business.
1380875;96757491;2016-08-24;51611350;Samantha;"Our host was friendly and accommodating. The location was outstanding and the room was one of our highlights in Amsterdam. 
This wasn't an issue for us but the stairs may be an issue for people who don't like steep staircases. Overall our stay was amazing and we would love to stay again during our next visit to Amsterdam."
1380875;108022371;2016-10-14;8439715;Brittany;Great place! A lot of stairs but other than that the place was very cute and the deck was amazing!
1380875;115362606;2016-11-24;2126741;Dawn;"Iris has a lovely place in a residential apartment/condo complex that is within walking distance to food places, and most importantly the tram that come by regularly to take you to busier parts of town and the train station.  
It was easy getting to and from Iris's place and the station.  
We don't have much interaction with Iris after we checked in because we were out and about almost the entire time we were there and only come back to shower and sleep.  
Everything in the place is spic and span.  We were worry that it might be too cold in the room since it was 40s (F) and wet outside, but it was very comfortable.  Her place felt like home away from home.  
The room is on the top floor with its own shower and kitchen with stove and microwave.  Iris and her family are in the 2nd floor.  The stairs are steep and narrow so might be difficult for those who have disabilities.
The only issue that we had was there was no wi-fi.   It seems to work for Iris but not for us.  Since our phone has data plan, and we were there for one night to sleep and rest, that didn't bother us too much.  If you really need data, there's service that you can purchase online. When I went into the wi-fi settings on the phone, it's one of the ones listed.  You select on it to connect, and it'll open up a browser for you to register and purchase service.
Overall, we definitely recommend her place.  We could easily stay a week or month there if the wi-fi works."
1380875;116150676;2016-11-28;47932985;Rosa;"We have had a good time in Iris apartment. It is really nice and comfortable with the only exception of the stairs (but We think is very common in Amsterdam). Clean and tidy. The bed is wide and comfy. The kitchen is perfect and so that the bathroom. The heating was ok (we have stayed in November).
The neighbourhood is very trendy and lively but quiet. There are restaurants,shops and supermarkets; well comunicated with the city centre by tram (only 3 min from the house to take it,and 15 min to the centre).You can also rent a bike (Iris told us of a renting place near the house we went to) that We really recommend just as you get to any touritic place in about 15- 20 min, And also because of the pleasure of biking the city and the canals.
Finally telling that Iris was very helpful and was available for our questions. She helped us with the bikes, gave us a map of the city,and also helped us to reserve a taxi as our fligt was very early in the morning.

My 5 year old daughter particularly loved the snake den. The location is great for de pijp and if you a travelling by car very easy to get to. We were even able to pay for parking outside. The communication before we went was great and the handbook useful. We would definitely stay here again.
2633912;30445193;2015-04-22;7908747;Gerhard;The Appartement was as shows on the pictures. Very nice and clean. The highlight was the roofterrrase. Agaath was very helpful before the journey and always available during the days in Amsterdam.
2633912;65511144;2016-03-15;26745593;Babs;Die Unterkunft von Agaath war genau wie beschrieben bzw hat sie unsere Erwartungen eigentlich übertroffen! Die Wohnung ist super gelegen, zentral, aber dennoch ruhig. Das lichtdurchflutete Ess- und Wohnzimmer lädt zum Verweilen ein und wir konnten sogar (Mitte März) jeden Tag die Sonne auf der tollen Rooftopterrasse genießen. Das Badezimmer und Schlafzimmer erfüllt alle Ansprüche und ist nett eingerichtet. Gleich in der Nähe findet man sowohl den Supermarkt, als auch einen Bäcker und zahlreiche leckere Restaurants. Alles in allem eine TOP Wohnung, die wir sofort wieder buchen würden.

5959225;74011062;2016-05-12;55239083;Maria Zely;The location of the building is amazing! The host is equally good, helping us to go upstairs with our HUGE luggage, showing us everything about the appartment and giving us very good tips about the neighborhood. The host gave us lot of attention and provided us a very comfy and clean appartment. Hope to be back in Amsterdam, to stay at Dan's place, for sure.
5959225;82991450;2016-06-30;59791777;Sandro;Dan was very welcoming and helpful on our arrival, answering any questions we had and giving us great advise. The place itself was great, and couldn't be better situated! Inside, the rooms were spacious and very well kept. Overall, I'd highly recommend Dan as a host in Amsterdam
5959225;93438523;2016-08-12;60056588;Paul;"Dan arranged for a friend to meet us and help us carry our luggage up the stairs to the apartment.
 The apartment was very clean and large enough for our party of 6 adults. The beds were very comfortable, and after a long day of exploring the city this was very much appreciated. 
 The location was excellent, and a great base to explore Amsterdam from. Rembrandt Square is lively, and vibrant with a fabulous selection of cafes, bars and restaurants to suit all tastes. Most of these bars are open until the early hours of the morning, but any noise from the square did not disturb us. I should add the bars and clubs and cafes do not have music blaring from every opening (as is the norm in  the UK) and the groups of young people enjoying the services of these establishments are not falling about drunk as they leave.
 My party consisted of 6 females aged from 16 - 65 and we all felt very safe in Rembrandt Square and other parts of Amsterdam.
The only thing I would point out is the stairs going up to the 3rd floor apartment are very steep and narrow (however I understand this is normal for apartments in the City) so if you have difficulty climbing stairs you need to consider this. 
We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and I would highly recommend Dan's apartment if you are thinking of visiting Amsterdam.  
If you are only staying for a short break I would recommend you do the 24hr City Sightseeing (red buses and canal boats) hop on - hop off tour. There are 3 routes you can use, 2 by boat and 1 by bus. It's a great way to get to see all the best that Amsterdam as to offer. The tickets can be bought at any ticket and tour office. There is one just a few doors down from Dan's apartment."
5959225;103911287;2016-09-24;1912214;Josh;Dan's apartment was a great spot for exploring Amsterdam, especially the nightlife. The apartment is very centrally located and easy to find from pretty much anywhere in the city. The accommodations are modest and the living room tight for 6 people but all in all it's a great base for doing it up in Amsterdam. Recommended.
6777861;44173081;2015-08-24;39808903;Andrew;Great experience staying at Millie's apartment. It was very clean and had everything we needed. Millie was very laid back and a very polite host. Would definitely recommend!
6777861;47821947;2015-09-21;7272148;Nick;Location was great, the studio was very tidy and comfortable, and Millie was a very thoughtful host in providing a loaf of bread (was starving when I arrived late at night) ! Would definitely come back again.

It's located close to a tram stop and at a walking distance from many points of interest."
4697359;76370289;2016-05-26;27347637;Thomas;Unique penthouse in wonderful Amsterdam. Loved everything about this exclusive penthouse. Shame we could not use it more during out stay but we exhibited. Qilin was great host and was very attentative ensuring everything was in order and arranged key exchange with friend in order to provide us early and convenient exchange. Great area next to park. Would recommend penthouse to anyone!
4697359;93143072;2016-08-11;73021022;Nicolas;"Très bon séjour, on était 6. on a passé un très bon moment. 
Attention aux marches ;)
Qilin très aimable.
Appartement très charmant, le rooftop est délicieux.
Je le conseille vivement!"
9642058;58047821;2015-12-31;18282792;Alek;"Erik made visiting Amsterdam very easy! We had a fairly late arrival, and he was happy to stay up and meet us and make sure we settled in appropriately. After check-in, he offered to be available for any assistance or as a guide around town.

The basement apartment is in a great location. It was an easy walk to nearly everything we wanted to see and do. Very good spot for short or long stays since there is a grocery store nearby and a well equipped kitchen.

Overall we are very happy with our stay in Amsterdam thanks to Erik!"
9642058;120575322;2016-12-11;926627;Andreas;A fantastic place to stay...great location, comfortable accommodations, private, clean...would definitely revisit Erik's place again.

7214386;126923020;2017-01-15;34404073;Dave;Couldn't have asked for a better place at this price. Perfect location, amazing view and near everything. Even the steep staircase was a little fun :) I highly recommend it
7214386;134115093;2017-02-26;62800872;Andrew;This apartment could not have been in a better location in the city. It was located next to lots of restaurants and beautifully situated on the canal. You might hear some street noise at night. The apartment itself is very nice inside. It had a very cozy living room.
15912260;115834309;2016-11-27;55860996;Bryan;Fantastic private apt for a short or long stay. Well managed.

El apartamento es muy agradable, bien equipado y con buena ubicación.
Recomendable."
689623;14996995;2014-06-30;5098141;Mikko;Katinka has a beautiful place just next to the Amsterdam city center. We loved the quiet neighbourhood and could easily plan of staying again. Katinka responded very promptly to any of our inquiries and made the extended weekend one to remember.
689623;70861407;2016-04-21;22579967;Anne-Sophie;"Nous avons été accueillis par le fils de Katinka, très chaleureux et disponible pour répondre à toutes nos questions.
L'appartement est très agréable, un coup de coeur pour le lit très douillet et confortable.
Même s'il n'est pas en plein centre, on accède assez rapidement aux lieux à visiter, le quartier est calme.
Merci beaucoup d'avoir contribué aux bons souvenirs de notre séjour !"
689623;104081619;2016-09-25;77431269;Jerome;"L'appartement de Katinka est vraiment charmant: du fait de son exposition et de son architecture, nous avons l'impression d’être sur un bateau.
L'intérieur nous a fait voyager dans une colonie britannique des Indes : c'est vraiment dépaysant.
Engin merci à notre hôte est très accueillante et nous a ouvert ses portes avec joie.
Nous recommandons vivement l'appartement de Katinka pour un séjour réussi !"
7359834;49369662;2015-10-03;26859680;Dave;Excellent host, location and accommodations. (Stairs are steep and narrow, caution to the less agile. ) Vin was very helpful.
7359834;51443044;2015-10-20;42454579;Robert;Accommodation, hospitality and atmosphere at the apartment was great. The neighborhood is quiet, excellent place to get away from the large crowds that prevails in the center and to rest  properly :)   It was really a big pleasure to meet Vin, Alfred and his girlfriend with whom we shared kitchen and living room without any hesitation. They are very nice and friendly so we had a great time. They are always on your disposal if some help and information nedeed. We felt really relaxed , just like we know each other for years. I recommend to everyone, you will not regret! All the best!!!  Robert & Alex
7359834;63531075;2016-02-23;59660439;Yahia;Vin was an incredible welcoming and accommodating host, he and his friend made us tea on arrival and we felt comfortable the moment we arrived. Vin was flexible enough to accept our request to stay despite us giving him short notice which was very kind too. The room was lovely, the apartment was modern, clean and spacious, and even the neighbour's cat kept popping in! Overall this was the perfect experience, topped off by the wonderful expert recommendations Vin gave of nearby places to eat.
7359834;64687039;2016-03-06;57364282;Gillart;super accueil, merci Vin. tout était parfait.
7359834;66906157;2016-03-25;59713406;Theresa;"Both Vin and Alfred were very welcoming and my boyfriend and I enjoyed staying at their place a lot. It´s close to the centre (15 minutes by tram) and a lovely and quiet spot in Amsterdam.
They also gave many tips and we felt like home from the beginning. We can highly recommend this place !"
7359834;68004568;2016-04-01;39937381;Barbara;"Super tof en gezellige kamer en zeer hartelijke welkom!
Echt een aanrader om amsterdam te bezoeken! met advies en vriendelijkheid van Vin :)
niet ver gelegen van zeer goedkope parking (1 euros per dag met tramticket tot het center!)"
7359834;83757410;2016-07-04;77908356;Jared;"I felt very welcomed and assured that I was in a safe clean place. Vin was very personable and I was invited to join him and his friends for a home cooked meal ;)"
7359834;84086852;2016-07-05;79440140;Chih-Jen;"Our host Alfred is a very nice person.
Sad that we don't have much time to spend with Vin, but I'm sure he must be a very nice guy too.
The room is very comfy and clean.
And due to staying on the first floor, we don't need to carry our luggage upstair which is an advantage."
7359834;130772000;2017-02-08;100850910;Nicola;Lovely home in Amsterdam! Very good communication and easy check in.
7359834;135231554;2017-03-04;117785788;Simona;Great people you can always choose them as your host.
5142163;45052815;2015-08-31;26737152;Fred;Marleen's apartment was great....well equipped, in a quiet neighborhood, great view out the big windows of the canal, and perfectly situated out of the main tourist area, but super convenient to public transportation via the tram which stops across the street. She was working outside of Amsterdam when we arrived, so her parents met us, showed us how things in the apartment worked, and gave us pointers on how to get around and things to see. We had a very enjoyable stay.
5142163;50477582;2015-10-12;22407214;Dario;We were well received. The apartment corresponds perfectly to the description and the location is central.
5142163;53985549;2015-11-15;1666752;Todd;Had a really great stay in Amsterdam! The apt was in such a cute spot, very close to center town, I walked everywhere!  Apt has great interior style and windows, too. Thanks again!
7813333;90078319;2016-07-31;20324994;Shanks;Great meeting Tamar and Maarten , they were very helpfull. Appartment is in great cool location with everthing on ur doorstep :)
3042134;14621684;2014-06-23;10501925;Silvia;"Hello!!
I and my parents visited Amsterdam this month. We rented Umut apartment.
I never met Umut but he was very interesting all the time about us and about how can he give the keys.
The apartment is fantastic for 2,3,4 persons. It's big, very confortable and you can use the kitchen if you need.
The localization, peeeeeerfeeeeeect!! There are supermarkets near, 3'-5' from the apartment, museums are near, etc etc ... All it's near.
It's perfect the public transport to go to the airport. There is a bus 3' from the apartment go direct to the airport, you can use to arrive from the airport to the apartment too, the numbers bus is 197.

Our experience in Umut apartment was really fantastic and perfect.

Thanks very much again!!! Umut, if we come back we will go to your apartment"
3042134;16094958;2014-07-22;16274311;Julie;"Very nice, spacious, but cosy apartment. It has a small terrace to the backyard, where it's very quiet. Though, if you step outside the front door you're in the middle of the shopping-street.
We did not meet Umut in person, but a friend of his provided us with info and keys. All in all, a chill stay at a chill aparment."
3042134;19358267;2014-09-11;15478939;Hernani;Umut was a very good host. The best thing about his place is its location, very close to many good atractions of Amsterdam, but still a quiet place if you need some rest.
3042134;20600996;2014-10-02;17317716;Ale;Very well position, very well host and then very good Holiday. I'll definitely return.
3042134;36104014;2015-06-25;32622617;Ray;"The location is fantastic, and the amount of space ( given the location ) is great too.  The host wasn't available to meet us, but he arranged for a friend to be there ( who went well out of his way to help us ).

The specific address was VERY difficult for us to find. It is on a plein ( square ) whose numbers are laid out in a totally illogical manner.  The stairs are shockingly steep ( like a ladder ), but that seems to be relatively common in Amsterdam.  The ceilings are low on the third floor ( I'm over 2 meters tall and hit my head several times ).

There is a tram stop located very nearby. The convenience was nice, but we were worried about the noise. As it turned out, though, it wasn't too bothersome.  The space was also quite clean and secure. The beds ( memory foam? ) were comfortable.  The view of the bustling street below was also cool."
3042134;47661821;2015-09-21;34154890;Beril;Great location! Umut wasn't available to meet, but he arranged easily for us. We loved the apartment, thanks for everything!
13162341;87039747;2016-07-18;6528022;Julian;Great place! Rooftop is exactly how it looks like on the pictures!
5854531;34460541;2015-06-08;23547662;Cath;OH MY GOODNESS !!!! This was our first experience with air bnb and now all others have a lot to live up to. Francoise and Roman were so welcoming and delightful, they drew us a map and told us of great places to go. They were so kind. Their house is so amazing, it is truly a gift to stay in their home. It was a perfect location, out of the hustle and bustle but only a short walk to the centre of everything. THANKYOU so much for letting us stay, we will always remember you and your kindness, with love xx
5854531;39518449;2015-07-24;24686392;Shelly;"We received a warm welcome and lots of good advice from our hosts regarding places to visit, both those that are well known ""must sees"" as well as some off the beaten path.  

The flat was spotless, comfortable and well appointed.  Could not have asked for better experience in a traditional Amsterdam neighborhood.  Highly recommend."
5854531;68348381;2016-04-04;54643791;Steffen;Das Haus in dem wunderschönen Amsterdamer Stadtteil Jordaan war sehr gemütlich, geschmackvoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Es war alles vorhanden und in bestem Zustand. Die Beschreibung und die Bilder stimmten mit den Gegebenheiten überein. Wir würden gerne wieder kommen und bedanken uns ganz herzlich bei unseren Gastgebern Roman & Francoise. Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit in Amsterdam.
5854531;81894361;2016-06-25;46134115;Michael;"Highly recommended. Great house - although very old, 3 level, and wonky in a timeless & charming  kind of way! 
The home has a great lived in feel and sensibility. Really enjoyed staying here and wonderful neighbourhood  
Would definitely stay here again."
7474662;100535047;2016-09-09;17568713;Laura;Cute studio and Hein gave us great tips!
7474662;103503849;2016-09-22;5165896;Arnaud;Hein est très sympa et le logement est très pratique pour qui souhaite passer quelques jours à Amsterdam afin de visiter la ville.
7474662;114169471;2016-11-16;517987;Valda;Hein's was a great host. Please follow his directions to his place and you can't go wrong. It was raining the day I arrived and got off to the wrong street. Hein's offered to come and meet me but I said would find his place. On my arrival so gracious and as he was cooking asked if I wanted a plate. Just absolutely what I needed having not eaten and I must say the best coleslaw I have ever had. Please be sure to ask Hein's about places to visit and he is a wealth of information on Amsterdam. I was able to visit a windmill in the city and go to a unique market that had best lamb sandwich. This place is cozy and unique and you should definitely enjoy.
7474662;115363919;2016-11-24;48283623;Step;The flat was great. Close to downtown but not necessarily in the muck of everything. It was easy to get around and I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go. Hein was a great host and made great suggestions. I would recommend these accommodations to any person or couple traveling through Amsterdam.
7474662;127820978;2017-01-21;49206602;Akissi;Great location, lovely small studio. It opens right onto the street, which could be an issue for some but wasn't for us at all ( the street is nice an quiet). Hein enjoyed taking time to tell us about Amsterdam,  which he knows really well, and gave us great pointers. We also took him up on his great offer to rent two marvelous bikes. We will be back! :)
7474662;132134605;2017-02-16;64784361;Nathalia;"Hein is an awesome person. He gave us great advises to enjoy Amsterdam. The apartment is good for two people, great location and it has the necessary for a short stay. 
Hein, you're welcome to visit Colombia anytime you want :)"
13183525;100623113;2016-09-10;72169731;David;Our host checked in with us a few days in advance and answered our few questions, met us on arrival and showed us around the apartment, and made us feel very welcome. We mentioned it was our anniversary and our host had a bottle of wine waiting.  It's a great place, easy walk to the central station, in a quiet neighborhood but near much--NEMO, the maritime museum, a beautiful windmill, grocery stores and good restaurants.  Canal boat ride hop-on point nearby. The apartment is on the 3rd floor with a small balcony, and the place is homey, as if you were housesitting for a friend. The kitchen, bath, and so on are typically small for an Amsterdam apt., but plenty for two people.  We loved having the porch to sit outside on and have a meal or watch the many birds.  Caveats: The stairs to the 3rd floor (again, as is typical in Amsterdam) are somewhat narrow and steep.  We (fit middle-agers with only carry-on luggage) had no problems, but if you have mobility issues or lots of luggage, you may.  Second, this is a an apartment home, not a hotel, so it was clear we'd want to keep decent quiet hours and otherwise be respectful of neighbors.  But we really felt at home here and enjoyed it very much.
12281340;85230019;2016-07-10;2042493;Emily;We had a great stay at Sandino's apartment. They left us fresh bread and fruit which was such a nice touch! The apartment is quite small for 4 people, but is manageable. It's in a nice location with a couple of nice cafes and bars, but it is quite a distance from the centre of Amsterdam.
12281340;92753728;2016-08-09;68487436;凯;房东人很好,非常好沟通。在入住之前,也一直积极与我联系。并且准备了新鲜的面包与水果招待我们,非常贴心!房子的位置很好找,并且拥有相当不错的视野,整栋楼临着一条美丽的河。不过对于携带着份量不轻的行李的游客来说,房子的位置距离最近的地铁站以及市中心均有着不小的距离,对于4个人居住,卧室也稍微小了些。不过总体还是不错的!
12281340;124596613;2017-01-02;103854802;Nicolas;Sandino nous a fait parvenir les informations nécessaires pour accéder à son logement. L'appartement était très fonctionnel et très charmant. Le quartier accessible avec beaucoup de commerces à proximité.
12281340;129633145;2017-02-01;72630048;Jacob;Sandino's apartment was exactly as described and felt very welcoming. My friend and I spent a great 2 weeks there and it really made us feel like locals as opposed to tourists. The neighbourhood is very quiet and friendly, with plenty of little shops to buy a cheap meal or snack. Public transport isn't very far away and getting to the city center is very easy. I would gladly stay here again if I returned to Amsterdam. Thank you, San!
5930115;58393217;2016-01-02;27139742;Ian;We had a wonderful time staying at Rudy's lovely home - it really felt like home away from home with the children toys and books - our kids had a ball.
9442082;88112825;2016-07-23;77872132;Virginie;séjour formidable à bord du liberté, trés confortable et agréable, vue magnifique sur la ville, calme et accessible. Nous sommes enchanté de l'accueil et du merveilleux sourire de Monica, nous reviendrons!
17292384;135499287;2017-03-05;114317017;Kyle;Emanuele's place was quite nice. It was clean, beautiful, spacious, and next to the metro. Not sure why the listing says this flat has a hot tub. Would not recommend this apartment to anybody with trouble climbing stairs. That said, I would definitely stay here again.
1745483;17729550;2014-08-16;1751604;Sarah;Susan was so welcoming and accommodating to us on very short notice. The apartment was very cozy and clean and there were fresh linens and towels. Location was ideal from everything we wanted to do/see and we highly recommend Susan's apartment for whoever wants a local's experience in Amsterdam.
1745483;30627376;2015-04-25;19015208;Chris;Great flat, in a lovely location, great base for exploring the city.
1745483;32459810;2015-05-18;20953493;Luis;Loved the stay at Lovely and Calm! It was spacious and in a quiet street in Amsterdam. Getting to placing from here was a breeze. I would recommend this place to anyone, it can accommodate at least 3 to 4 easily and felt like home.
1745483;45090354;2015-08-31;8673757;Camille;thank you Susan for making our stay in Amsterdam so nice. We enjoyed the time we spent in this appartement. The welcoming by Franklin was very appreciated as he gave us nice advices to eat and hang around in the city. Moreover, the place was exactly as expected and as described : perfect. Clean, comfortable, very well situated, calm etc.. And they let us some breakfast stuff.
1745483;48414569;2015-09-26;28846569;Benedict;This is a lovely apartment in a absolutely beautiful street. Is very nice inside and very comfortable. A great kitchen if you want to cook yourself which I recommend to really appreciate your environment. No problems, all good!
1745483;53324144;2015-11-08;28580105;Jess;"Susan was an excellent host despite not having the opportunity to meet her. She was contactable at all times by phone and made sure there was someone at the apartment to welcome us. 

The apartment could not be in a better location. Less than 10 minutes from the station, 5 minutes from the buzzing centre but in a quiet street with no noise at night.

The apartment had everything we needed to feel at home during our stay and was full of character!  The living/kitchen area had loads of tall windows letting in lots of light and you had a fantastic view of the surrounding streets."
1745483;115145118;2016-11-22;15045149;Mary;The neighborhood was great.  The apartment was lovely.  We would highly recommend this listing for a visit to Amsterdam.
14101392;114144756;2016-11-16;101993498;Anjhali;We had a great stay, the apartment is very nice and clean, perfect for a couple. Close to the city center, about 20 minutes by foot. Some nice cafés and restaurants in the neighbourhood.
14101392;120680588;2016-12-11;10467663;Sarah;Had an amazing stay at Maarten & Diana's apartment. Key pickup was very convenient, and the apartment is right around the corner from an underground stop, so getting there and around the city was very easy. Quieter neighborhood at night, but plenty to do if you want to go out! Everything was clean and tidy, and the hosts were kind enough to leave me a few sweets for my arrival. They were also very easy to reach and very responsive. Would highly recommend staying here!
14101392;139235636;2017-03-24;59680116;Amanda;Maarten and Diana were so fast at replying to all messages. The location of the place is really nice and there is a lot to do. The space was comfortable and really clean. Can't wait to come back some day.
11341995;97199104;2016-08-26;20343248;Sona;Het was erg gezellig om bij Lia en Jaap te kunnen verblijven. Heel rustig, heel aangenaam. Ze beide zijn heel vriendelijke mensen. Ik heb ervan zo veel genoten.
4462332;53064359;2015-11-04;22244950;Jeff;Jane met us in the restaurant below the apartment which was as easy a checking in to a hotel.  We stayed over the Halloween weekend when the place downstairs was hosting a few big loud parties.  Jane told us about them as she was showing us around the place. We stayed out late so it was not a problem but it was great to have the notice.  The apartment is in a great location.  We will stay here on our next visit to Amsterdam.
4462332;58504926;2016-01-03;33995467;Ali;"In general, we had a great time in Amsterdam. The host was kind to let us check-in earlier than the usual time. 

The apartment is excellent and perfectly located for those who want to travel to Amsterdam for fun and party. It is close to many shopping areas and restaurants. It is also a very comfortable place with all the needed amenities. It also has a nice small balcony on the back side.

The only remark I would make is that the apartment was a bit dusty. Apart of that, everything was great and we has a wonderful stay.

I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends. Thank you Coco for everything."
9702511;98083829;2016-08-29;63209122;Mona;We had a great stay in Amsterdam at Claire's appartment. The house is very unique and cosy! Claire is very accessible and communication was very good. She has made her own city manual which came in very handy! It was great that we got to use the bikes. I would definitley recommend staying here.
15780515;114145711;2016-11-16;24685569;Chris;Perfect place to enjoy the best of Amsterdam. Everything went smoothly from check in to check out. Beautiful place in the centre of Amsterdam. Recommended.
15780515;123879086;2016-12-31;15232281;Dave;Fantastic host, fantastic place! Super close to the centre of the city. Would most definitely stay here again!!!
15780515;127997026;2017-01-22;26551916;Renée;"Prachtig appartement! Top locatie! 
Alles is aanwezig om je even in luxe onder te dompelen en dat met precies genoeg persoonlijke  aandacht en oog voor detail.
Aanrader!"
15780515;139652866;2017-03-26;110847644;Sharon;Beautiful apartment near to Vondelpark which we loved. Bed absolutely fantastic! Our host was always helpful. Highly recommended base for visiting the city down a quiet side street.
15670095;135429419;2017-03-05;27852800;Lukas;The place is just great! Really easy to get to (free ferry from the train station and then 10-15min walk). Although I would suggest getting an uber if you come at night (from the city centre it's only 10-15 EUR). The place was really clean with fresh towels, tv, internet, and all the kitchen stuff one might need.
6533303;37986140;2015-07-12;29380045;Julie;Our host made us feel very welcome through comprehensive explanations prior to our arrival, and having a friend meet us upon arrival and welcome us. He also left us a bottle of wine. The neighborhood was central, green and lovely, with a nice cafe on the corner. We fully enjoyed our stay!

Situated in Silodam approximately 15 minutes walk from Central Station, this has to be one of the best locations in Amsterdam.

Built by MVRDV architects this structure gets more intriguing every time time you enter the building. Overlooking Amsterdam North you are treated to perfect view of the River. There is no need for television when you have a constant display of boats, sailing vessels and huge passenger ships passing your window day and night, it never ever gets dull. 

The apartment is secure, tastefully decorated with a great kitchen equipped with everything you could possible need. There is cable TV, excellent internet access, a stereo and headphones for your ipod, air-conditioning, and plenty of space to keep clothes and luggage.

Within 5 minute walk you are at the start of the Prinsengracht Canal and within 15 minutes you can be in the centre of Amsterdam, where all you will find all the shops, restaurants, bars and green spaces you could need to get a real feel for Amsterdam life.  

If you cycle you are actually never far away from all the great places to go.

Wilfred and Marianne provided us with everything we could possible need; bikes, parking and advice on where to go and what to do.  Our lovely hosts made our stay just that extra bit special."

Charlotte's breakfast was the gratest... Like in a 5 stars hotel! She would always set the most perfect table at 9:30 and called us to eat. Awesome!

She was very helpful with tips and tricks around the city and more.

In few words Charlotte is the most amazing host ever! Always with a big smile on her face! 

Thank you so much for a Wonderful time. 

Hope to see tou soon ;)

The location is great so we walked everywhere, also there's a daily market just down the road.  Charlotte is friendly and very kind. She prepared a nice breakfast for us each morning.Thank you for the pleasant stay !
1942156;12275256;2014-04-28;12332107;Claudia;I had a great stay at Charlotte's place in Amsterdam. She was an excellent host, very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and bright, as was the rest of the flat. Unfortunately we did not have time to make use of the roof terrace, but it offered some great views of Amsterdam. Breakfast was at a time of our convenience and left us feeling full until late into the afternoon. Conveniently located near the museums and a short walk into the centre, I would definitely stay here again.
1942156;12815822;2014-05-12;1906557;Joelle;"Pour une première fois à Amsterdam ce fût une très belle expérience! Le choix du quartier d'abord: DE PIJP, au calme, trés bien desservi par les trams, et à 5 minutes des musées RIJKS et VAN GOGH. Plein de petits restos sympa autour, et le grand marché  populaire ALBERTCUYP. Notre  logement: une chambre sous les toits, super mimi, exactement comme sur la photo, trés bonne literie, grande douche, coin séjour avec frigo, super propre, aucun bruit. Charlotte,  enfin: charmante, discrète, attentive, elle est là quand il faut, et nous a préparé chaque matin un petit dej à nous caler pour toute la journée. Que des bons produits, frais, un régal!.
Merci beaucoup charlotte, nous recommanderons son trés joli  appartement et son sens de l'accueil. C'est juste ce que l'on attend chez ""air bnb"""

Evertything was perfect, exactly like on the pictures. The room and the bathroom are very clean, and we could enjoy the roof terrasse, so nice! 
We had a nice breakfast every morning, with a delicious fresh orange juice, and a wide variety of marmelades, peanut butter etc. 
The area is very nice, with the famous Albert Cyup nerby, and many restaurants and bars. 
We definitely ad a nice journey in Amsterdam, thank you Charlotte."
1942156;16081924;2014-07-22;15255003;Maria-Rosa;A very nice room and very friendly host. Charlotte was very friendly and answered questions immediately. The room is very cute. There is everything you need for comfortable accommodation. The location is perfect - a very easy walk to the train station, with the line 16 or 24 you can quickly get to the centre of Amsterdam. Would stay here again! Thanks for a great stay in Amsterdam.

Additionally, Charlotte offers a a nice and healthy breakfast. 
The area De Pijp is perfect, 2 tram stops from Museumspleijn, and directly connected to the train station, all the sights are easily accessible. The area is safe and offers many nice shops and good restaurants off the beaten track. We can highly recommend this place and would book it again any time."

The room was comfortable and clean and the shower in the room is really useful. We didn't have any problem with the shared toilet.
Every morning Charlotte made us a delicious breakfast at the time we asked for.
Charlotte is a nice host, she was very pleasent, kind and friendly and if you need help or suggestions you can surely ask her.
I spent there a really good time and I suggest her as a host!"

Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Charlotte et Harry dans leur home sweet home plus que charmant !!! Belle atmosphère, intérieur super chouette !
Notre chambre était parfaite, bonne literie, pièce d'eau agréable et fonctionnelle. La bouilloire pour le thé et la machine à café étaient bienvenus. 
Les petits déjeuners de Charlotte sont délicieux (orange pressée, pains de toutes sortes, confitures, oeufs, fromage...).
Le quartier De pijp est un quartier animé et fort sympathique à vivre !!! de nombreux restos, des cafés bruns, le grand marché... et facile d'accès !!!
Une très BONNE adresse !!!
Merci Charlotte"

L'appartement est superbe, la ""petite"" chambre est très intime et agréable.  Les petits déjeuners sont à la hauteur de leur réputation.... Délicieusement délicieux! La terrasse sur le toit est un bonheur. Nous avons regretté n'être partis que 4 jours (3 nuits) et prévoyons de retourner dans cette capitale : chez Charlotte, ça c'est sur!!"
1942156;31512670;2015-05-06;20640807;Stéphanie;Nous avons été hyper bien accueillies par Charlotte. La chambre est agréable, confortable, calme et très bien équipée. Il y a de quoi se préparer un thé, un café, et même de petites boîtes qui renferment des douceurs ( chocolats, caramels). Charlotte est disponible et discrète à la fois ce qui est parfait pour se sentir à l'aise et passer un très bon séjour. L'appartement est lumineux, le mobilier et la déco sont très sympas et il est vraiment bien situé ( il y a un arrêt de tram mais il est facile de visiter à pied). Le quartier est sympa, avec des lieux magiques comme le Bazar ( pour manger), De taart van m'n tante ( pour déguster une tarte maison à se damner), etc. Ravies pour cette 1ère expérience airbnb et 1er séjour à Amsterdam d'être tombées sur une hôtesse aussi gentille. Je confirme les petits déjeuners sont délicieux !
1942156;32689675;2015-05-20;30000668;Nicolas;"Für uns war es der erste AirBnB-Aufenthalt und es war wirklich super! Charlotte war echt nett, sehr zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Wir konnten bereits morgens anreisen und unser Gepäck ablegen, was sehr praktisch für uns war.

Das Zimmer (wir waren in dem kleineren der zwei Zimmer) war sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, so wie auch der Rest der Wohnung. Ein TV an der Wand, eigene Dusche mit Waschbecken sowie Kühlschrank und Senseo-Maschine standen für uns bereit. Kaffee gab's übrigens gratis - toll! Handtücher wurden uns ebenfalls gestellt. Die Toilette befand sich in einem separaten Raum. Alles war sehr sauber und gepflegt. Das Frühstück war ebenfalls klasse und sehr liebevoll vorbereitet. Kaffee, Tee, Wurst, Käse und sogar frisch gepresster Orangensaft stand bereit.

Die Umgebung der Wohnung ist top. Reichlich Bars, Restaurants und Läden befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nähe. Die Auswahl an Restaurants und Bars ist weitaus besser und hochwertiger als im Zentrum Amsterdams.

Alles in Allem können wir die Wohnung nur weiterempfehlen. Bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt in Amsterdam, besuchen wir Charlotte gern wieder."
1942156;43034022;2015-08-17;799815;Aless & Voss;Charlotte is a fantastic host. She prepared a delicious and hearty breakfast for us each morning which we always looked forward to! Charlotte's place is beautifully decorated with artwork and the room is very comfortable and well equipped. The best part about Charlotte's place is the incredible roof terrace with 360 degree view of the city. In our opinion, Charlotte's roof terrace is the best spot in Amsterdam to enjoy a glass of champagne.
1942156;87363025;2016-07-19;64718632;Sarah;The nice apartment was perfectly located and Charlotte was very friendly. Breakfast was great and we really felt at home during our stay.

1942156;106568024;2016-10-06;50393309;Gabriel;Spacious apartment. The roof space is really cool and it seemed like the only apartment building that had this nearby. Good food and great neighborhood. Charlotte is very lovely and goes for the extra mile in terms of being a host. She offers a lot of simple but great advice. She is also very patient and friendly. Highly recommended, would stay here again if I would ever visit Amsterdam again.
1942156;112280458;2016-11-05;38215093;Babette;"wir haben uns sehr gut aufgehoben gefühlt! die möglichkeit, tee, kaffee zu machen und der kleine kühlschrank waren super praktisch.

1942156;120857355;2016-12-12;32875885;Amelia;Could not recommend Charlotte's apartment high enough. The flat itself is beautiful, and Charlotte as a host was fantastic. Had a beautiful breakfast waiting for us each morning and she was really helpful and easy to get along with. De Pijp as an area is great, lots of nice bars and cafes without the hordes or tourists, and is only a short walk to the centre. Worth every penny! Would definitely stay again.
2749719;31874693;2015-05-11;25544445;Nicole;Fijn appartement op een centrale plek in de stad. Dakterras is heerlijk. Leuke eettentjes in de buurt op loopafstand. Plek om een keer terug te komen, we hebben genoten!
2749719;66594972;2016-03-23;37219453;Angelie;Excellent location in the middle of the Jordaan, with very good access to the nine streets for shopping, eating and bars. A lovely apartment with every amenity you might need but there are a lot of steps up to the apartment so be careful if you have mobility issues.
13199180;79535843;2016-06-13;73608149;Marianne;"We had a great time in the 'Stylish Marina cottage'.

++ Location
The 'cottage' is located at a marina (jachthaven), we love the atmosphere
The marina is located near the very nice 'Nieuwendammerdijk' definitely worth a visit

++ A lot of room in the cottage. 2 double bed rooms, but if you bring an air bed, you can easily stay with 6 people

++ Free parking

+ Nicely decorated.

+ Basic things available like coffee maker + free coffee. Dishwasher with tabs, big fridge, microwave+oven etc.

- The 'cottage' is technically in a bad state. We didn't mind much, but we can imagine some visitors would not like this, so worth mentioning.
The whole appartment is 'tilted', including the floor. Toilet flusher leaking. Due to the tilted floor, water stays in the shower base, cannot run out. Mice are running around (or at least 1) It is smelly (probably due to the mice).

When asking questions via Airbnb, it took a lot of time getting an answer from 'Jack'. Sending SMS worked.
Once you he responds, you get a nice and friendly reply"
13199180;94936494;2016-08-17;75654046;Thayn;Highly recommended! Beautiful setting with all amenities . Friendly and helpful host. Lovely to go for walks around to the sound of gulls . We look forward to spending another few days there before we leave for India .
13199180;100070968;2016-09-07;93036204;Mohammed;"Worst ever.
Attacked by the dog, unfriendly receptionist defended the dog!
Place is a boat junk yard, not like the pictures.
Inside was dirty and not ready. The maid started cleaning when we arrived.
We decided not to stay, and the receptionist said it’s better that we were going!
Ruined our experience. And no refund!
Worst ever."

Beautiful home overlooking the water with everything you could wish for including (my nephew's favourite) chickens and bunny rabbits to feed in the garden! Bart and Manon were incredibly accommodating and were very prompt in their replies to any of my requests. There were four of us staying (3 adults and a toddler) and the size was perfect. Also having a car parking space outside the house made things really easy. Our hosts had also prepared a handbook with information about the house and tips for places to visit and how to get there. All in all a very positive experience. We would love to stay here again on our next visit. Thank you!

Location is great, 5 minutes bike to go to any cool places, nice restaurants around, groceries ect. The appartment is very nice, well decorated, and has everything you need to fell like home. We specially enjoyed the 2 sunny bedrooms, the very nice balcony, best place for a morning coffee and the amazing brand new bathroom!

2543110;34762245;2015-06-12;23491400;Claudia;Our family of 4 adults stayed in Sophie's apt for 9 days.  Sophie is a great host and was very helpful with any questions we had. The listing is quite accurate.  The apt is delightful, comfortable, clean and well equipped.  The location is great - one can easily walk or take the tram to everything in Amsterdam. Wonderful local cafe's and restaurants just down the street.  I highly recommend staying here.  Of note, as in all of Amsterdam, the stairs are quite narrow and steep.  Thank you again Sophie!

9913868;61053773;2016-01-31;6513994;Gretchen;"We REALLY enjoyed our stay at the canal loft! Great location and view in a super quiet neighborhood, it was the perfect cozy and warm temporary home during our four-night stay. Although the bedroom has only a few hooks for clothes storage (we travel light so that wasn't a problem for us), the bed is very comfortable. The shower was also wonderful; constant temperature and good water pressure. Wifi signal was strong, and cable TV also a plus. Even though our arrival time was close to 9 pm, key pick-up was quick and easy as our host left it at a nearby cafe/bar. Our host's thoughtful waffle cookie welcome gift were much appreciated as was the coffee and tea provided. There are many sights and great restaurants within walking distance too. I highly recommend staying here to anyone needing a comfortable and convenient home base while exploring the city."
12941208;78361934;2016-06-06;24727323;Zana;Jose made me feel most welcome in her lovely appartment which is just as shown in the photos. My room was spacious, light and very comfortable with a view over the garden. She gave me plenty of privacy and was very helpful should you need anything. The area is perfect, only few stations to Dam Square,cute shops, cafés and some of the best food we've eaten this trip. Easy access to public transit and public parks. What a nice spot! I totally recommend staying here. :)

5848273;55443945;2015-12-01;840089;Roxanne;"Maurine was very easy to communicate with prior to arrival. She gave me all of the information necessary for the apartment and how to arrive. When we arrived Maurine hired a cleaner to have the room ready for us.

The room itself was pleasant, it had a comfortable bed. There is also a nice curtain that blocks out most sunlight. The room does not face the street so it is pretty quiet. There is also a private shower inside the room. The toilet is shared but is just outside of the room.

The neighborhood is great for exploring Amsterdam. It is a quiet and  trendy neighborhood right by the canals. It's a place where people actually live so it's not touristy. But you can easily walk to any tourist attraction in about 15 minutes.

Maurine was very understanding and accommodating of our needs and I would recommend her as a host."
1201952;44176526;2015-08-24;22747355;Bogdan;"We ordered Ekaterina's apartment because it was simply the cheapest offer at the airbnb. We were prepared for worst, but nope. Apartments was very ok, very clean, big balcony, totally same as at photos. Neighborhood was super, 15 min by bike to the central station, tram/bus stop within 2 min walking distance, few supermarkets in 5 min.
Few words about the householder: We arrived late at the night, but it was not a big problem for Ekaterina, we managed to get to the home after 00:00 (thank you Ekaterina!). She was always online, so we could simply ask any questions and Ekaterina was happy to help us."

I would definitely recommend it :-)"
3565477;37942578;2015-07-12;25385816;Jennifer;Julie was the most friendly and welcoming of hosts from the moment we booked her wonderful apartment until the end of our stay.  Her apartment was cozy and relaxing and was even better than we here hoping for.  It was clean, organized and inviting with personalized touches to make our stay perfect in all ways.  Julie supplied us with all sorts of information we might need during our stay and made sure we knew how to reach her at any time with questions.  The location of this apartment was a huge plus we did not realize until we got to know Amsterdam better.  This area of the city is great and getting around was a breeze.  I would very highly recommend this host and this apartment to anyone.
3565477;73386946;2016-05-08;25212384;Wolfgang;"Nettes Appartement in ruhiger Lage, wie beschrieben. Stadtviertel im Stil der Amsterdamer Schule, sehr hübsch, das Museum Het Schip um die Ecke. Kneipen und Restaurants fußläufig in der Nachbarschaft. Zu Fuß in 5 Minuten im Westerpark, in 15 Minuten im Jordaan. Mit (zum Appartement gehörenden) Fahrrädern natürlich schneller. Julie war sehr hilfsbereit und immer ansprechbar. 5-Sterne-Host!!! 
Wer zu dritt nach Amsterdam fährt und nicht unbedingt im Zentrum, sondern etwas ruhiger wohnen will, sollte das Appartement unbedingt in Betracht ziehen."
7931500;58902044;2016-01-05;8690956;Kevin;Elsebé's 2nd floor apartment is awesome. Been to Amsterdam ~ 5x and have stayed in Abnb's each time and it was definitely the best. Great location and super clean. Elsebé is also an amazing host, great communicator, and even left us a snack and bottle of cava. Highly recommended!!
3171364;16690314;2014-07-31;18149392;Mia;Olivier was the perfect host! He was helpful throughout our whole stay, he even changed his plans to meet us with the keys, when we arrived earlier than planned. He gave us space, but at the same time he was there whenever we needed something. The apartment was very clean, and even more nice and roomy than it looks in the pictures. The neighbourhood is quiet, but it's not far from the metro station, and not a long walk from the centre. We would definitely stay here again. Than you so much for a lovely stay!
3171364;21173101;2014-10-12;11125941;Basia;"The place itself is nice, although not in a strict centre but it is really well communicated (just 5min away from a metro station) and neighbourhood is quiet at night - exactly what you need after whole day of sightseeing etc. ;)

Amstel station is quite near and there are some interesting places around you can just walk to.

We spent just a few minutes with Olivier (because of his personal arrangements) and he was helpful and friendly. 
It is a good choice if you visit Amsterdam just for a few days unless you are oversized because the bathroom is really tiny.  :)"

Leurs conseils nous ont bien aidé pour partir à la découverte de la jolie ville qu'est Amsterdam.  L'appartement est idéalement bien situé par rapport au centre d'Amsterdam, à seulement 2 stations de métro, et très joli. Très bon rapport qualité/prix. Je conseille vivement cet appartement :)

The apartment is in a convenient location and exactly the same as the photos are showing. I would highly recommend it to people who would like to be close to the heart of Amsterdam but out of the hustle and bustle of the city.

Si trova in una posizione centralissima per chi vuole godersi la città ed è molto accogliente per chi invece cerca un po' di tranquillità. Nell'appartamento c'è tutto, dalla cucina fornita di tutto al balcone privato. Iris è sempre stata gentile e disponibile per ogni nostra necessità. 
Ci torneremo sicuramente!"

8139460;109749432;2016-10-23;13647621;Cynthia;"A beautiful and very comfortable house located in a nice neighborhood  of Amsterdam, with lots of attractions nearby (including a brewery/pub) and easy access to transportation. All kitchen/laundry hardware is in perfect condition, as are other amenities (glassware, utensils etc). 

The living room is very ample while the bedrooms are a bit smaller, but that doesn't really cause any hindrances. The beds are so comfortable it's ridiculous. We basically had to fight with the pillows and mattress to get up and go about our day in the city. :)

It's a place that sure seems very well taken care of. The only minor inconvenience (for those who are more demanding about privacy) is the glass windows in the front, which were covered with curtains. But that doesn't detract at all from the overall experience. Definitely worthy of going back!"
2633912;22915276;2014-11-17;23154768;Nathalie;"Bel appartement, conforme à la description. Calme et cosy, à la déco à la fois zen et chaleureuse. La cuisine est très bien équipée et très agréable. Tres facile d'accès depuis la gare Centrale. Situé dans le quartier du Jordan, à deux pas du marché Noordermarkt et des transports en commun (tram, bus) même si le vélo est le moyen de transport idéal.
Agaath nous a accueillis chaleureusement, soucieuse de notre confort. Elle nous a indiqué les centres d'intérêts et les transports les plus proches.
Nous avons passé un très bon week-end et nous recommandons cet appartement, confortable et bien situé."

5959225;39157803;2015-07-21;16090742;Virginie;The cleaning lady, Rita, was very friendly. The flat is in a very busy area and therefore quite noisy in the night but still safe and friendly.
5959225;45140937;2015-08-31;40095662;Marvin;The contact was great, we were picked up from the railway station and taken to the apartment.
5959225;49138732;2015-10-01;26075026;Patrick;Dan was an excellent host and met us on time exactly where we arranged to meet and provided all the necessary information we needed, the place was amazing and in great location with great views across the Rembrandtplein, it was a decent size apartment and a real pleasure to stay in right in the centre of the city I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam, I would definitely use this apartment again :)!
5959225;51043988;2015-10-17;44514188;Selina;Dan hat uns geholfen das Gepäck die vielen Treppen hochzutragen. Die Wohnung lag sehr zentral, was für uns Jugendliche sehr gut war. Abends könnte man raus in die Bars und Diskos gehen,welche direkt vor der Tür waren. Coco's Outback hat uns besonders gut gefallen. Die Betten in der Wohnung waren bequem. Alles in allem hat es uns dort sehr viel Spaß gemacht. Auf jedenfall sehr zu empfehlen. Eine Sache die man vielleicht bemängeln könnte wäre, dass die Küche viel kleiner ist als auf den Fotos angegeben (das war für uns aber kein Problem).
5959225;54112098;2015-11-16;22718422;Rehana;"The apartment is centrally located and very easy to get to from the airport. It is within walking distance of most of the places to visit whilst in amsterdam. Dan was very helpful with information and helped in getting luggage up the stairs. The stairs are very steep but it was expected from previous reviews so wasn't  a problem. There were three bedrooms and two small bathrooms which was enough for our group of 5.

The only problem we did have was that the apartment was very cold. We were told, after we were shown to the apartment that he would be back in an hour to fix the heating however he never showed up, we just kept waiting. We had a busy day so thought maybe he would return the next day. We did message via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) again the following day but the situation wasn't solved and the birthday girl ended up getting ill. 

Overall we had a wonderful experience and would consider staying at the apartment again if we visited again if the heating could really be sorted."
5959225;56620428;2015-12-15;13056899;Felix;Great apartment in the heart of Amsterdam. Completely recommend everyone to stay at Dans apt. Close to bars, restaurant, clubs, and so on. Perfect location

5959225;70837433;2016-04-21;37819872;Didier;The appartement is situaded in the very center of Amsterdam, just in front of Rembrandtplein. Photos show very well how it is organized. No bad surprise, in a flat all in black and white, modern and good looking style, in a historical house.
5959225;77211026;2016-05-30;24111290;Marc;The location is fantastic and the place was lovely and clean!
5959225;85904832;2016-07-13;52739180;Maryke;"The apartment is very well situated in Amsterdam, next to a tram stop and within close walking distance of all tourist attractions. The apartment was very well kept and clean, and Dan left clear instructions on how to find the place and keys. The stairs leading up to the apartment are extremely small and steep, so it is extremely difficult to get your luggage up there - so travel light if you want to stay here.
We had some problems with a heater in the one room that was on and the knobb to switch it off was broken. Which does not work in summer. The front room is quite noisy, given the location, but the location is worth it."
5959225;87585115;2016-07-20;36125333;Christina;Our stay at Dan's place was amazing! The apartment was so beautiful and located right in the heart of everything. Dan was extremely helpful and could be contacted easily.

5959225;129087185;2017-01-29;93093522;Freyja;Thanks so much to Dan who was a brilliant host. It was a little difficult to contact him in the weeks coming up to the booking (he was on holiday with limited access to his emails), but he provided all of the necessary info about getting to and from the flat (and into it) in time before we checked in. There is not a possible way to describe how steep the stairs are! Although this is usual for Amsterdam and is common place in most houses/bars and restaurants. The flat is in a brilliant location, trams basically stop outside and pretty much everything is in walking distance which is great for exploring the city. The WiFi works well even with 6 people using it and there is space enough in the flat so it doesn't feel you're in each others space all the time. It is the perfect place for exploring and we would definitely stay again. Thanks Dan!

While being outside the center it is only a few minutes walk and the location is beautiful. The supermarket at the end of the street is open late (and on Sundays) and is packed with everything you may need.
The only thing is there seems to be a cat usually living there (we didn't meet it), so if you are allergic you might want to keep that in mind.
All in all a great experience which we would gladly repeat!"

C'était très pratique pour laisser la voiture le temps de notre séjour sur Amsterdam (après plus besoin d'elle grâce aux trams et vélos).

L'appartement est très bien situé, un peu excentré mais proche du centre grâce aux quelques arrêts de tram (15 mns environ). A quelques rues se trouvent des commerces de type super marché pour faire ses courses et une pharmacie... L'appartement se trouve dans un quartier tranquille.

Vin a un appartement très agréable qui permet aussi bien d'y être tranquille mais aussi de venir discuter autour d'un petit verre (s'il fait beau, la terrasse est très agréable). 

Notre chambre était cosy et le lit très confortable. C'est tout ce dont nous avions besoin après une bonne journée d'escapade dans Amsterdam.

Enfin, un mot sur Vin et Alfred, ce sont des hôtes vraiment très accueillant et amicaux. Ils aiment partager avec leurs invités. Et nous avons vraiment apprécié passer ses trois jours chez eux. Si vous vous rendez chez eux, n'hésitez pas à discuter avec eux. Ils seront de bon conseil pour votre visite d'Amsterdam."

7359834;94614916;2016-08-16;46705920;Michael;Nice Room not too far away from Amsterdam Central. The distance to the city is perfect to rent a bike (unfortunatly we couldnt find a nearby bike rental so we got one in the city) and drive the way to the old town or a small beach nearby. The room is on the ground floor so heavy luggage is no problem. Was definitely a nice stay and a location we can recommend :)
7359834;130652402;2017-02-07;111412754;Elizaveta;One of the most comfortable places. There was everything we needed in the bedroom, toilet and bathroom. There's also a large kitchen and a TV lounge and even a guitar we were permitted to play on. We also found the district quite silent and beautiful.
5142163;27551128;2015-03-07;2884685;Rose Mary;The place was great!  Plenty of sun, well stocked kitchen for all of your cooking needs, and located right by tram 3 or just a little further down by plenty of buses and trams that get you all over Amsterdam.  Or you can just walk to Haalmerdjik with its super cute shops and restaurants.  For those with longer stays, that's where you can also get groceries, get your laundry washed, etc.

When we go back to Amsterdam I would ask Marleen if we could stay again.
5142163;69475023;2016-04-11;33959545;Lawrie;Lovely apartment with all the necessities and only steps from the tram to the museum centre. We were very happy with our stay at Marleen's apt. Did not get to meet her but her father was very helpful when we had a question. Would definitely recommend.

The host was communicative and friendly, as was his friend who showed us to the apartment and answered all our questions. The location is perfect - tons of restaurants, bars, museums, grocery stores, public transport all within a very short walking distance. 

We stayed in during gay pride week, so it was rather noisy in the front bedroom due to revelers into the wee hours of the morning. The back bedroom and terrace were very quiet, however. 

We loved the apartment and we would definitely stay here again (but maybe not without earplugs during large festivals.)"
3042134;17676076;2014-08-16;14918020;Orson;Amazing apartment in the canals Amsterdam could walk everywhere including centraal station and the museum quarter. Umut was extremely helpful with information regarding the area, where to go and what to do. Apartment was spacious and well lit, slightly noisy but overall a great stay. There is no oven only a microwave which was a slight inconvenience.
3042134;19736466;2014-09-17;19520997;Gabriel;"Umut was busy with something personal so we never met him. But he figure out a way to get us the keys ( thanks Nashila! ).
The place  was great, we rented the whole place because we needed 2 bedrooms and I can tell you that the living room is awesome, very spacious.
The location is really close to Leidseplein Square.
Awesome place!
The only con is the showering. The water is rather weak and with 4 people to shower took us longer than expected.
Umut really cares about the place, its really neat and well organized!"
3042134;27015564;2015-02-23;9496859;Hanna;Very nice apartment in a great location to access the City.  All communication with the host was good & very helpful.  Would stay here again
3042134;36756092;2015-07-01;25671411;Ben;"Umut's accommodation was great. It was very spacious bright, and looked exactly how is does in the photos. A large living/kitchen area looking out over central Amsterdam, with two rooms upstairs both with double beds. 
The only issue is if you don't like loud noises coming from the street at all hours of the night, don't stay here. The location is central to many bars and night spots.  

It was very easy to contact Umut, he was very prompt with his response and informative. We even got lost on our way to his apartment, Umut then proceeded to meet us and take us there. 
If i ever go to Amsterdam again I will be trying to stay in Umut's apartment."

The area was a mix of quiet residential area but with really nice shops/ bars/ restaurants dotted around if you look. It was also very close to the centre / 9 streets area which seemed like the nicest area in Amsterdam. We walked into the centre most days. I would definitely stay here again.

It’s a perfect apartment for a short (or long) stay.

Veerle and Bjorn were very friendly and gave us useful tips regarding parking and traveling to the apartment already prior our visit. 
On arrival Veerle welcomed us very friendly, showed us her very nice apartment and offered us to contact her at any time, if we need help, no matter what. 
The apartment is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam, very quiet in a secondary road, but as soon as you walk 200 meters outside the door you find several nice cafes, restaurants, a huge market and public transportation. The quarter is very nice with a good mixture of people. 
Inside there is nothing to recommend, the apartment is clean, cut very fancy and equipped with everything you need and more (even Netflix on the huge LCD :))
We would definitely book this apartment again for our next Amsterdam trip!"
3389300;39493243;2015-07-24;15639190;Michael;Veerle has a super apartment in a great location of Amsterdam.  The apartment looks as is/better than the photos and everything is as described.  Veerle was super accommodating when it came to our arrival and departure as well as supplied a lot of information about the local area.  We enjoyed staying a little bit out of the hustle and bustle of the tourist area to have some more local spots all in walking distance.  The balcony was a huge plus of this apartment as well as all the natural light that came in all of the windows.  When back in Amsterdam, will def get this place again. :)
3389300;62003663;2016-02-10;26551980;Renata;"Really enjoyed our stay at Veerle's apartment. Apartment was very clean and also we very liked the interior. Location of apartment is good, just note that you will probably end up taking a tram to the center, but that was not a problem for us. 
Veerle was very accommodating, easy to communicate and quick to respond -  a very good host!
I would definitely recommend this apartment"
3389300;77071356;2016-05-30;35481786;Hugh;My wife and I stayed in the apartment for two nights at the end of May 2016.  The apartment is really cosy.  It had everything we needed.  We loved the balcony.  We especially loved the area.  De Pijp is a very easy going and fun part of Amsterdam.  Very good communication with Veerle and Bjorn.  Overall a great stay, would definitely recommend.
3389300;120689716;2016-12-11;46557750;Eva;"This place is so nice, great style yet simple. We never met the hosts in person but they were accommodating and always responsive on texts so we felt very welcome and looked after. 
There is also a super cute terrace, which would be very nice in the summer..
The place has a very good location, quiet but close to everything in the cool De Pijb area. So many good cafes and shops close by. We loved our stay here. I can highly recommend staying here if you want to experience Amsterdam like a local!"
3081736;67051262;2016-03-26;2322659;Ian & Rahat;Lovely flat in a great location, very easy to get around. Hannah is such a kind and responsive host even when she's not in the country but we are well looked after. Oh, and nice comfy bed.
1145866;68739907;2016-04-06;45264273;Vincenzo;We had lovely time! The place is very well linled with the centre(the tram is minute walking) and the host was really kind and helpfull.
1145866;70068467;2016-04-15;43878627;Ramin;Daniella's room looked exactly like on the pictures, the apartment was clean and the bathroom amazing. The location is perfect if you want to roam to downtown or the vondelpark. Daniella herself was 100% responsive and very quick with her answers.
1145866;75883476;2016-05-23;51370542;Laura;"Daniella muy amable, nos recibió nos explico todo lo que teníamos que saber de su apt y medios de transporte. Un lugar muy bien ubicado a poco minutos del centro y del metro para ir al aeropueto. A sus alrededores tienes muchos restaurantes y tiendas. La habitación estaba muy amplia con una camada muy muy cómoda.   

Muchas gracias Daniela.
Sin duda volvería."
1145866;82336067;2016-06-27;63580727;Andrea;"A very comfortable location 10 minutes to central station.
Daniella has been very kind since the beginning and the room was simply perfect for a weekend holiday."
1145866;95816851;2016-08-21;60469256;Karin;"Daniella's Raum ist sehr gepflegt & man kommt gut alleine oder zu 2 unter :)
Daniella ist auch sehr hilfsbereit und nett, sie versucht immer schnell weiter zu helfen!

Man kommt von der Wohnung sehr einfach direkt in die stadt, gute öffentliche Verbindungen!
Gerne wieder :D"
1145866;108046029;2016-10-14;80523870;Karim;Very Nice and comfortable . Bathroom was top notch and the whole place was very clean . I really enjoyed my stay .
1145866;126742222;2017-01-14;53397229;Becky;We had a great stay here at Daniella's appartment, we didn't spend a lot of time in the appartment apart from the evenings when we got home but it was perfect for what we needed. The location was great with trams/buses outside the appartments that go straight into Amsterdam centre, which takes about 15/20 mins. The bed was soooo comfy! So we both had fab sleeps every night! Everything all lovely and clean. Worth the stay! :)
1145866;130765053;2017-02-08;67774892;Robert;The room is clean, good location and Daniella is a verry carefull host. I recomend.
5614235;29309330;2015-04-06;19282019;Léo;Propriétaire tres sympathique, il nous a même fournit un chauffage. Le logement était bien décrit et tres propre. Une sorte de camping en plein Amsterdam. Douche a 15 min de marche. Centre a 30 min. Logement parfait pour les petits budget et les gens pas difficile
5614235;41391281;2015-08-07;36957733;Nadine;Wir hatten eine klasse Zeit auf Montys Boot. Er half wo er konnte und war sehr zuverlässig. Die Zeit auf dem Boot ist ein kleines Abenteuer. Mit dem Duschen hatten wir es nicht ganz so einfach, da das Freibad saniert wurde und wir daher nur die öffentlichen Duschen mit denen man sich vor dem Duschen abduscht zur Verfügung hatten. Auf dem Nachbarboot hätten wir uns allerdings auch mit der Seewasserdusche abbrausen können. Da das Boot über ein Waschbecken verfügt, kann man dort auch die Haare waschen. Die Innenstadt konnten wir Fußläufig sehr gut erreichen, wobei Fahrräder sicher in Amsterdam immer die praktischere Wahl als Verkehrsmittel sind. Also falls ihr für ein Abenteuer offen und nicht von zu viel komfort abhängig seid, um eine tolle und günstige Zeit in Amsterdam zu erleben, dann seid ihr auf Montys Boot genau richtig! :)
5614235;62941897;2016-02-18;33121311;Sarah;Monty is a very good host, very kind and patient. The boat is really cosy, all in wood and with the candle light, it's really plaisant. All the more so that the city center is reachable in 15 minutes.
5614235;75616020;2016-05-22;61927372;Larissa;"We had to leave one day earlier, because of rats in the boat! They ate our food although it was wrapped. We never got the money from the last night back, although the owner said so.
It's a cute boat and it was a nice trip but the circumstances were really, really disappointing"
5614235;76720293;2016-05-29;26913399;Quentin;"Très bonne et spéciale expérience dans un bateau à Amsterdam. 
A 30mn à pied ou 10mn en bus du centre, le bateau est bien placé. 
Après, il faut aimer l'aventure : ni eau ni electricité, il n'y a que le minimum mais beaucoup de tranquillité.

C'est juste un peu cher pour ce que c'est (nous avons payé 179€ pour 2 nuits, tout frais inclus)"
5614235;82282150;2016-06-27;11466128;Vincenzo;"Monty e' stato un host molto discreto ma al tempo stesso disponibile.
La barca non e' tenuta benissimo e come descritto non ha doccia e il bagno e' abbastanza limitato.
Il canale su cui e' ormeggiata e' tranquillissimo.
Ben collegato al centro (due fermate di autobus) e con parcheggio gratuito.
Soggiorno molto speciale, non lo raccomanderei pero' per piu' di una notte."
5614235;84328473;2016-07-06;81720246;Tobias;Monty is a very nice guy! Cozy boat! Highly recommendable
5614235;89576536;2016-07-29;81724456;Jad;Monty was a nice host although we only saw him for about a minute. The boat was nice all in all and the location was easy and not so far from central city.
5614235;92109323;2016-08-07;19648236;Francesco;"Monty was very kind and gentle,he had even two bikes to rent for us.
The position was not excelent but with the bike it was not to much distant from the centre.
Nice experience ;)"
5614235;98512665;2016-08-31;16003826;Corentin;"We really enjoyed this experience. It was perfect for one night stay ! Monty was awesome. 

Definetly recommended !"

6640744;34745965;2015-06-11;4733852;Robert;"We've had a very nice stay at Henk's place. Our host was very kind and guestfree. The appartment was great, very nearby the Vondelpark and Leidse Square.

And on top of it all, he took us on a boattrip through the Amsterdam Canals, great sightseeing. Henk knows a lot about the city, so we learned a few things as well about Amsterdam we didn't know about.

When we go back to Amsterdam, we will first try to book this appartment again."
6640744;41960998;2015-08-10;35755988;Juliane;Wir hatten ein tolles Wochenende in Amsterdam und haben uns bei Henk sehr wohl gefühlt. Sowohl der Aufenthalt, als auch das Ankommen und Abreisen waren unkompliziert und nett. Das Apartment ist fussläufig und mit der Tram gut zu erreichen. Wir haben alles so vorgefunden wie es beschrieben war und sind sehr zufrieden.
6640744;46277498;2015-09-09;1284181;Stephanie;Henk has a beautiful apartment. The room and bathroom are spacious and comfortable, and Henk was a gracious, responsive host. Stay here if you have the opportunity!
6640744;48169047;2015-09-24;36426927;James;Our visit with Henk could not have been better. He greeted us upon arrival, showed us the second floor of his which be our residence while in Amsterdam. The place was spacious with a large bedroom, well appointed bathroom, and ad very large sitting room. Everything we needed was provided: linens, towels, eating utensils and dishes, and plenty of info on visiting Amsterdam. Henk was always available for questions. Could not have asked for more of him or his place.
6640744;50656166;2015-10-13;4253365;Emma;We had a wonderful stay at Henk's apartment. It is located on a main road, a short walk from the centre and right next to the Vondelpark. The apartment itself is quiet, spacious and beautiful. There is no kitchen, but there is a kettle and coffee machine, and Henk left refreshments in a mini fridge. Henk lives on the floor below, so is available if you have any queries, and he was very understanding when we turned up late after a problem at the airport! I would definitely recommend this as a base for exploring Amsterdam.
6640744;65018253;2016-03-10;44309183;Jang;Henk is very good person. It was very comfortable place. Thanks a lot.
6640744;68946325;2016-04-08;44244929;Adam;Exactly as the other reviews have said- lovely apartment in a perfect spot for seeing the sights of Amsterdam. Didn't see much of Henk but he provided everything we needed for our stay.
4666510;35338738;2015-06-17;12456551;Ute;Die Lage ist super, Schlüsselübergabe hat gut geklappt. Das Schlafsofa ist leider nicht sehr bequem.
4666510;37063562;2015-07-04;7953144;Lea;We had a little trouble getting in since nobody was at the apartment at the agreed time. The apartment is excellent and so is the location. We also got a late check out witch was very kind and we didn't need to carry our bags on the last day.
4666510;39924080;2015-07-27;31704086;Claude;"Très bien situé (à quelques pas de 2 stations de transports en commun), bien équipé en matériel de cuisine, de lavage et de couchage pour 3 personnes, l'appartement de Silvan est un lieu idéal pour passer un agréable séjour de découverte à Berlin. Le quartier est vivant (bars et restaurants à proximité) mais l'appartement au 2ème étage d'un petit immeuble de qualité est suffisamment bien insonorisé pour y passer des nuits de repos au calme dans une literie de qualité.
Silvan, qui nous avait donné toutes les informations que nous souhaitions avant notre arrivée, a aussi répondu très rapidement aux questions pratiques que nous lui avons posé pendant le séjour par messages via Airbnb. Merci à Silvan et à Anna qui nous a accueilli à l'arrivée.
Nous recommandons très vivement cette adresse du Mitte pour qui veut passer une ou deux semaines à Berlin."
4666510;49376221;2015-10-03;24295244;Alket;Silvan apartment is located in a prime place near almost all major attractions in the city. Has great access to public transportation and surrounded by many great restaurants. It was very easy to find the place after Silvan gave the directions. He was very kind to let his gf wait for me to handle the keys after a flight delay. Apartment is very clean lots of light and very quiet. Loved it all and will for sure take it again
4666510;81152236;2016-06-21;24064086;Amanda;Highly recommended, lovely apartment and lovely hosts. Thank you!

1331407;40224191;2015-07-29;26605327;Michael;We had a great stay at Conny and Daniel's flat.  Very spacious with everything we needed, and located in an interesting part of the city.  Conny and Daniel were very responsive and friendly with any questions we had.  Would definitely recommend.  Thanks!
1331407;40958389;2015-08-03;6057600;Eva Dorothée;Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt und sie ist wirklich super geeignet für Familien mit Kindern! Die Wohnung ist sehr ansprechend und individuell eingerichtet, typisch Berlin eben! Wir haben Conny und ihren Mann nicht persönlich getroffen, aber es lief alles total unkompliziert ab. Die Lage der Wohnung ist super, aber das wussten wir vorher schon, denn wir haben selbst mal in diesem Haus gewohnt. Vielen Dank auch für den Begrüßungswein (den wir allerdings nicht getrunken haben, da ich schwanger bin...) Gewöhnungsbedürftig ist nur, dass es im Schlafzimmer keine Gardinen gibt und man sich dort im Bett ein bisschen wie auf dem Präsentierteller fühlt. Ansonsten: Super Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis und eine klare Empfehlung!
1331407;51570059;2015-10-21;5428405;Tamara;We had a great time in Conny and Daniel's appartment! Good location nearby the Mauerpark, best kids room ever. U bahn nearby, supermarket around the corner and enough places in the neighborhood to go to for breakfast, dinner or a drink. The appartment   is clean and equipped with everything you need. We would definitely recommand the place to others!
1331407;52233318;2015-10-27;7299349;Julie;Super séjour dans cet appatement idéalement situé ! La chambre est un vrai royaume pour les enfants.

3956008;26139242;2015-02-04;23542745;Clayton;I didn't see Mariietta that much during my short stay but she was very friendly, helpful and reliable.  Her apartment is also very nice and the neighborhood is perfect for whatever you are wanting in Berlin, hang out or be near downtown.
3956008;27190995;2015-02-27;26532977;Jonas;"Simple, really cosy room in a really central area of Berlin ! Everything is at walking distance! Even though I didn't see Mariietta at all she was extremely (!) friendly, helpfull, uncomplicated and she, for sure, must be an Awesome person to know ! Aswell the communication went easy, the room/appartement was really clean and she got good movies to watch on the DVD player!
Well, to sum up, everything was perfect and I would defenetly book it again !
Tschuss Marietta and maybe see you around in Berlin one day !

3956008;28144796;2015-03-18;28909203;Richard;I cannot recommend Marii's place highly enough. It's in the perfect Kreuzberg location - a great variety of bars, clubs and restaurants all on your doorstep. The room is bigger than it looks in the photos and Marii is a great host, always ready to help. I will be returning asap!
3956008;41177658;2015-08-04;4069162;Roberta;"Marietta was super nice ! She was easy to communicate with, really welcoming and kind! Her house is lovely and really clean, really close to kottie, perfect if you come visiting berlin!

The room is clean and spacious. Great location and super easy with public transport!"
3956008;67652179;2016-03-30;39155573;Alexandre;Nice stay at Marie's place. The flat was well located (for us) very clean and cosy.  Marie was friendly and flexible. We'll came back. Thx again.
3956008;68663248;2016-04-06;38145684;Rüdig;Der Kontakt mit Marie war großartig. Sie hat schnell geantwortet und war sehr flexibel und super freundlich. Das Zimmer hätte besser nicht liegen können, mitten drin und schön eingerichtet. Das Appartement war sehr sauber und man hat sich wirklich gut aufgehoben gefühlt.
3956008;125179566;2017-01-04;12206152;Alena;"We really like our cosy room. Bright and nice. The bathroom was always clean. The location was perfect for us, as we wanted to be in the center of Kreuzberg: shops, bars, graffiti all around and U-ban close to us. Perfect!
Marie is a good host. We really enjoy talking with her. However we don't see each other often."

Her apartment is in a great location by the canal in Kreuzberg, just a few steps away from all the nice bars and restaurants. Very clean and tidy, it provided the perfect space for our quick getaway to Berlin."
3306282;28833817;2015-03-30;498246;Giovanni;"The flat is nice and located in a quiet street near the bars and restaurants of Kreuzberg. It was very clean and in order.

3306282;29203355;2015-04-05;3486546;Teresa;Our trip to Berlin was great. The apartment seemed larger than on the pictures. It was very clean when we got there and had a great location in kreuzberg next to U1. Penelope was easy to get in contact with and answered all our questions.
3306282;31706523;2015-05-09;29519102;Shannon;Our stay at Penelope's apartment was wonderful.  It's a lovely, clean and comfortable flat in a great neibhborhood with loads to do and see all around.

Pénélope est très disponible et disponible pendant le séjour"
3306282;82444707;2016-06-27;3886580;Roxane;Lovely little apartment. Really clean and quiet. 5 minute walk from the U bahn in a really hip part of town.
984732;6845425;2013-08-27;6604206;Vanessa;We stayed for six days with our family (three adults and two little children, 5 months and two years old). The apartment is very nice and welcoming and the area is very quiet. Our hosts bought a fold-up baby bed which was very useful. We could use the bikes and there is a nice and sunny terrace. The connection to the center with Ubahn (or bus + Sbahn) takes about 30 minutes. The only problem we had is that we could use the Wifi through a Smartphone but it did not work on our MacBook. We would recommend this appartment as a nice place to stay if you are looking to a quiet stay out of the center of Berlin.
984732;45768344;2015-09-06;30706855;Renate;Wir waren 10 Tage in Manuelas schönen ruhigen Wohnung und haben uns super wohl gefühlt, die Wohnung hat alles was man braucht und besticht durch die schönen alten Möbel und die vielen Bücher.Der große Balkon  war  in diesem Sommer super zu nutzen . Der Bäcker für die morgendlichen Schrippen und die Zeitung gegenüber, und ein besonders gutes chinesiches Restaurant um die Ecke. Die Wohnung liegt verkehrstechnisch sehr günstig, 5 zu Fuß min U -Bahn Dahlem Dorf, auch ein Parkplatz gab es immer ganz nah.Für uns sehr wichtig, da ich mit meiner gehbehinderten Mutter unterwegs war. Die Übergabe durch einen Freund von Manuela hat reibungslos geklappt und wir würden jederzeit gerne wiederkommen. Renate und Hannelore aus Ravensburg
984732;65146965;2016-03-11;21840407;Franziska;Sehr ruhige Lage und trotzdem mit dem ÖV gut erreichbar.  Die Wohnung ist sehr gut ausgestattet und gemütlich eingerichtet. Internet ist schnell und die Küche ist 1a ausgestattet. Wir waren vier Erwachsene und hatten genug Platz. Angenehm ist das Bad mit einem separaten zweiten WC. Das Doppelbett ist eher schmal und somit eher für ein Paar. Besonders genossen habe ich die absolute Ruhe nachts! Die Schlüsselübergabe hat einwandfri geklappt. Gerne wieder!
1189460;5066614;2013-06-10;5881068;Sarah;Super Wohnung, perfekte Lage, netter Typ, alles super geklappt. Nur zu empfehlen.

Apartment is quiet (situated on the back of the building) and well equipped, we had all we needed, even gramophone and a lot of vinyls :)
Around there is plenty of bars and restaurants.
We had a wonderful stay in Berlin and we would highly recommend this place."

Unzählige Bars und Kneipen direkt vor der Tür - viel zu viele um sie alle auszuprobieren. Tipp: Der Kaiser's an der Brücke zur Warschauer Straße ist lediglich Sonntag 23:30 bis Montag 7:00 geschlossen - sonst durchgehend offen. ;-)"
1189460;127683693;2017-01-20;25533402;Jihyun;"Alfons is a very kind host and I enjoyed staying in this house. There are many cafes and restaurants around the house, and i like small but beautiful garden in front of the house. It was pity that I couldn't stay on Saturday, because there will be a famous market on Saturday in the garden...I want to recommend you staying in this house on Saturday ! This house is not modern but it has everything i need and heating is very nice. if you like vintages and ""real"" Berlin house, you will like this house. Thank you Alfons!"
8142475;61947661;2016-02-09;18630516;Nanna;I had two good days in Ellen's room. She was out travelling, so I only met her (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) who was very nice and helpfull. Very nice and big room in a nice neighborhood. Ellen had left a note with recommendations for cafés and bars in the area, but unfortunately I didn't have the time to visit them. I can certainly recommend to stay in Ellen's room.
8142475;104305215;2016-09-26;77724411;Vincent;"We really enjoyed Helen's flat. Nice flat with character, big room, clean shared spaces and bathroom and discreet room mates... The hood is nice with bars and good places to eat. S-bahn station near the flat, easy to go quickly everywhere in the city.
Would happily return, we recommend Helen's flat for your trip in Berlin."
282724;10137591;2014-02-02;11404924;Andreas;A very spacy, well designed and impeccably tidy appartment. Very good location in the western part of town. Central but very quiet. I liked the high speed internet and the very new and modern equipment (stove, shower). Highly recommended.
282724;12160091;2014-04-24;12951366;Ken;We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely, well-equipped, sunny apartment. It is very quiet but located in an area close to the city with very easy bus and metro travel, especially if you buy a Berlin Pass. There are numerous shops, cafés and restaurants nearby if only to have a beer to watch the world go by. It is on the second floor but there is an elevator. Marie's communication beforehand by email with tips for travel directions and restaurants was very helpful.
282724;26390335;2015-02-11;5930092;Micha;Marie's apartment was excellent - clean, cozy, quiet and equipped with everything needed. The location is grate too. Highly recommended! Thank you very much!
282724;33293433;2015-05-26;24559472;Darren;Marie communicated exceptionally well in the lead up to our stay. The apartment is located in an absolutely wonderful and convenient part of Berlin's West Side. The apartment was in a quiet area, was very clean and I highly recommend it to anyone looking at staying in Berlin!
282724;40079618;2015-07-28;9453115;Burton;"This was my second stay at Marie's apartment (I rented this apartment for three weeks last October 2014), so that in itself is a good indication of how pleased I was staying here. The apartment is located on a dead-end street, so it is completely quiet at all times! I love the fact that the apartment is compact and extremely clean! The host Marie is never intrusive, and she only contacted me with a ""welcome"" email and a ""bon voyage"" email. As I have relatives who permanently reside in Berlin, I am certain that I will continue to rent Marie's lovely apartment in the future."
282724;54279841;2015-11-17;196177;Sharon And Paul;Super clean, super quiet. Marie was easy to communicate and helpful.
282724;87813926;2016-07-21;54782819;Natascha;Das Appartment ist sonnig und gemütlich. Ich mochte vor allem den Platz und die Ruhe. Die Kommunikation mit Marie war sehr angenehm. Leider liess die Sauberkeit zu wünschen übrig.
282724;129661404;2017-02-01;48555228;Giulia;Marie's apartment is a bright and cozy shelter in the cold days of winter Berlin. It's clean and elegant. Coming back in here after a long day of work or discover, is such a sweet feeling. It's two mins away from all the possible connection to the rest of the city and there's a nice supermarket just aside. The neighborhood gives you everything you can desire if too tired to step across the city: restaurants, theater and so on. Marie's is friendly and very easy to keep in touch. Enjoy.
282724;131422235;2017-02-12;111413327;Rayna;This is a really good apartment as a base to explore Berlin. The apartment itself is accurate to the pictures and has a cosy feel. It is clean and in a very lovely area of Berlin. The public transport links are great and we felt very comfortable despite it being our first time in this city. Would highly recommend this apartment.
9873860;135961833;2017-03-07;56959417;Mar;El apartamento de Cintia y Simon es igual a la descripción, incluso mejor, todo muy limpio y ordenado. La habitación es muy espaciosa y la cama metraaaa cómoda. Nosotros no utilizamos nada pero la cocina está muy completa y tiene todo lo necesario para pasar unos días o incluso una estancia más larga. La ubicación no es céntrica pero es muy fácil llegar desde cualquier punto de la ciudad. Hay dos paradas de metro con buenas conexiones justo en la misma calle, así como sitios dónde comer y supermercados por la zona. La comunicación con Cintia y Simón fue muy buena antes de llegar, nuestro vuelo llegaba por la noche y Cintia nos esperó hasta tarde para recibirnos. Lo recomendamos y volveríamos sin ninguna duda. Gracias Cintia y Simón :)
9873860;136513799;2017-03-11;998779;Pawan;Good location. U9 ubahn is conveniently outside the building. A block away has for grocery stores and coffee shops.

1088794;92756448;2016-08-10;52291807;Supermary;We had a nice experience in Berlin. Claudia and her husband have been very helpful. Thank you!
1088794;96210360;2016-08-22;7832610;Nicole;Very nice place to stay! It had everything I needed and was perfect for my needs. While I didn't meet Claudia, her husband was very nice and explained everything well. Thanks for a lovely time!
1088794;106421570;2016-10-06;41142144;Gael;J'ai passé un bon séjour chez Claudia, qui s'est montrée agréable et serviable quand elle était présente, et toujours joignable en cas de question quand elle était absente. Elle était absente lors de mon arrivée, mais avait laissé la clé à ma disposition à deux pas de chez elle, et je n'ai eu aucun problème à accéder à l'appartement, qui est simple et propre. Je recommande l'appartement de Claudia, dont le seul point faible est d'être relativement éloigné du centre touristique (une bonne demi-heure de métro).
18375084;148710013;2017-05-01;33523502;Damien;"We were 5 to stay at Claudio's flat for 2 nights. Claudio is a nice host and his flat is very confortable. 

You can easily sleep 5  people. Furthermore, Claudio brought them a fridge and a microwave which is a good point for the next visitors.

The nearest U-station is a 3 minutes walk from the flat. You can go to Alexanderplatz in 10 minutes with the underground.

To sum up, it was a nice experience in Berlin."
2529429;11252076;2014-03-26;4610036;Lisa;Stefan was a great host. He was super nice, accommodating, and helpful. The room is simple, no frills, and it was easy to get around the city with the subway being a 10 minute walk from either direction.
2529429;12671928;2014-05-07;7955986;Klara;We spent by Stefan three nights and everything was exactly as described. The place was clean and quite.´We really enjoyed our stay.
2529429;12899170;2014-05-13;14598177;Annamária;Stefan was a great host, he made us feel really comfortable during our stay. The place was in a nice quarter, close to some of the most well-known sites and to connections to the public transportation. Will definitely choose his place again, if I go back.
10085101;132002573;2017-02-15;109501975;克佳;The house is really good,big and clean.The people who live here are also very nice and (URL HIDDEN) a good choice to live here
5469293;27955612;2015-03-15;244042;Oliver;The room was as presented, nice, clean and cozy. The mattress was very good. Celina made sure I had everything I needed, sheets, covers, towels. The place has an excellent location, just 5-10 minutes from a good U-bahn connection at Nollendorf. Very quiet neighbourhood and really nice roommates. Thank you, Celina.
1827536;51141933;2015-10-18;16080360;Francesco;"Alla was very kind and always available, and very prompt in replying to any doubt or request we submitted.
The flat was clean and tidy.
The location is definitely very functional: the two doorways of the building lead on one side to Greifenhagener Str., on the other side to Schoenhauser Allee, and therefore to shopping facilities (shopping malls and bio-supermarket), cultural goods (fancy used CD/DVD shop), and clothes. Furthermore, a U-Bahn and an S-Bahn station right behind the corner.
Two cons: the flat is on a ground level, and consequently quite dark, and somehow noisy (you can hear people walking just in front of your windows, and cars passing by), and we were provided with just one key to the building doors. However, especially the second is a minor issue.
Finally, we did not need to cook meals but breakfast; nevertheless, the kitchen seems not fully furnished (a microwave oven, a coffee machine, but only an electric cooker."
1827536;125521474;2017-01-06;45337769;Adriaan;Ruim appartement als je met 4 personen hier verblijft. Keuken is iets te klein, maar voldoende voor de standaard dingen als je niet al te uitgebreid kookt. Dicht bij de metro waar je alle kanten mee op kunt.

The apartment is clean, much bigger as you see on the photos and located in a very quite neighborhood. 
Everything is like described and you find everything what you need.
I can highly recommend this flat and say thank you Alberto for this pleasant stay."
3823118;77801391;2016-06-03;50324227;Nell;Alberto's apartment is beautiful, very spacious and light and quiet during the evenings. It's an 8 minute walk to the closest train station and very easy to get to from the airport. We didn't meet Alberto but he was responsive over email.
3823118;120687469;2016-12-11;31572950;Isabelle;Bel appartement spacieux au calme dans un quartier facilement accessible en métro et bus. Les conseils de visites d'Alberto étaient  intéressants et l’accueil par sa sœur  tout à fait sympa. A recommander !

6488461;46173407;2015-09-08;12701167;Neha;I stayed at Benjamin's place with two friends and it was perfect. The flat is really cozy and nicely decorated. It's bigger than it appears in the pictures.  The street that the flat is on is really quiet, but two blocks over and you're near restaurants, coffee shops, etc. (Ben helpfully provides a list of places to check out) Really enjoyed my stay here.
6488461;49734793;2015-10-05;37373494;John;Ben made us feel very at home and even accommodated our late arrival, due to bus delays. The apartment looks just like the pictures and we really enjoyed our stay. It is decorated supremely, full of recommendations and situated in a good area close to the transport we needed. We would definitely come back again
6488461;52993791;2015-11-03;8844639;Siobhan;"We really loved our stay in Ben's flat. It was a great location, so close to Boddinstrasse Station which was great for getting in and out of the city, however Kreuzberg and Mitte are very walkable. The area had so much to offer in terms of places to eat and drink and the amazing old airport strip behind his apartment where locals exercise and have their allotments is really a interesting place. 
The apartment itself was perfect for our needs. The pieces of art are so unique and loved the quietness of the area.
Would recommend staying here."
6488461;64230002;2016-03-01;39001843;Christin;War alles super. Die Wohnung ist einfach toll, total ruhig und doch zentral. Schön und unkompliziert die Kommunikation mit Benedikt. Vielen Dank wir hatten 1 schönen Tag und kommen gern wieder!

The neighborhood was pleasant. And we really like the tips about the places (bars, restos...) that Benedikt wrote on his kitchen door."
6488461;87655650;2016-07-21;390761;Matt;"Benedikt was a friendly and communicative host. The flat is pleasant and cosy, nicely decorated, in an older Schillerkiez building and with a great outlook over mature trees. This is a great area for a relaxed visit. 

Some space to put clothes  would have been useful and there were issues with water leaking from the cistern and the shower, so the bathroom floor was often quite wet."
6488461;107094313;2016-10-09;72247995;Sanja;Its very nice apartment, warm,clean  and our host Peter was very helpful. Apartment was exactly like you will see on photos. Metro station is very close what will assure you good connection with the rest of the city.

6604446;45591944;2015-09-04;16507465;Roni;Mika and Robert where simply ok.  We haven't met them but every thing was organized from the keys to the subway directions. Really nice place over all.

Wir hatten ein wunderschönes Wochenende bei Mika und Robert und würden diese Unterkunft jedem weiterempfehlen.

Mika und Robert sind wirklich sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Danke nochmal für den unkomplizierten und schnellen Kontakt und die Tipps und Hilfsbereitschaft vor Ort."

9273945;55466500;2015-12-01;13134988;Amy;The apartment and Silly were both fabulous.  The room was cosy and warm with lots of character and the kitchen was divine.  When you walk through the front door you know that the apartment is a happy and calm place, it just has that feel :)  would definitely recommend and stay here again, perfect location too!
9273945;55546422;2015-12-01;11359525;Oleksiy;"Fantastic artistic comfortable room with very pleasant host!
Found artistic Berlin spirit like nowhere else!"
9273945;55948333;2015-12-07;22565189;Jas;"I did not meet Silly but her son was waiting at the unit, even though we have a late night arrival, which we appreciate greatly as not all places accepted a late check in. He showed us around the place & provided us with the wifi password. The room was indeed an art box; it was very cosy and cool space with huge canvas of beautiful art works, some scupltures, fur rugs and a sitting corner as seen in the pictures and there were many thank you notes around the room, no doubt from previous happy guests. It felt like we were really stepping into an artist's space, which was very much how Berlin felt like as a city.

The location is quite central, a short walk to the nearest S-Bahn and a quick stroll from the tram stop. There were various bars and restaurants nearby for a late bite and a convenience store nearby to grab snacks or water.

While there were several lights, it could be dim for some guests but we didn't need much reading except for surfing to check our route so the three lamps sufficed. The door of the bathroom was slightly tricky as it was connected by a hook inside but could not be shut tight otherwise it proved tough to open after. The flush was also weak and the toilet bowl was choked on the last day when we woke up to leave. 

We had a lot of freedom and found the whole house to ourselves most of the time, so it was not a problem that there was a slight gap in the bathroom door.

Given the chance, I would be happy to stay here again!  :)"
9273945;58719257;2016-01-03;13825125;Isabelle;I only stayed one night at Silly's place but everything was ok. She always replied really fast to my messages and questions. The room was really nice. She provided towels. She was also really flexible with the check in and check out time which I liked. Upon arrival I got offered coffee. Felt right at home. Great neighborhood.
9273945;60611523;2016-01-25;25052135;Mrunal;Silly's place is just like home, only better. Everything about her and the place was welcoming, warm, fun, full of color and art. Love your paintings - and going out with you. Thanks for a great time in Berlin! Be good.
9273945;67384675;2016-03-29;51156349;Carlos;Nuestro paso por su casa fue corto, sólo 2 noches, no coincidimos con ella pero su compañero de piso nos atendió. El cuarto estaba bien, la cama era cómoda. El baño podría estar mejor. Cerca de la torre de la televisión y bien comunicado.  7/10
9273945;99758982;2016-09-05;51623886;Lisa;"Silly was a very easygoing and flexible host - cool with early check in, adding a second guest, and leaving luggage at the apt past check out. Her place is uniquely decorated yet also quintessentially Berlin - high ceilings, big windows and lovely balconies. It is old school but I loved that and thought everything was clean. Only thing I had slight trouble with was her front door lock - a little hard to turn the key but you get the hang of it. 

Thanks Silly :)"
9273945;104257802;2016-09-25;60102081;Nathalie;A very beautiful room in what appeared to be the absoluteley nicest neighbourhood of Berlin!

9528440;58098203;2015-12-31;4445285;Daphné;"I highly recomand Renate and Mike ' s place !
First of all they are really nice hostes. For example, when we arrived at Amsterdam by car (really not easy to find a place to park!) they recommanded us a secure place and then they even came, and drove us to the flat. (After the checkout, they drove us back too.)
The apartment is just like in the photos. Really cute, and we felt just like home :) 
Like it says on the post, it is just next to the canal and the city center. We also used the 2 bikes, perfect for visiting Amsterdam !
Thanks a lot Renate and Mike !!!"

È superfluo dire che la casa era fantastica e che non ci è mai mancato nulla in quanto Renate prima del nostro arrivo ha provveduto a metterci a disposizione una dispensa intera di biscotti e dolci tipici per la colazione di ogni giorno facendoci trovare in più anche una bottiglia di vino di benvenuto. Esperienza fantastica, da ripetere sicuramente!

4876528;29419562;2015-04-07;2894675;Jp;We had a great experience with the apartment, Vanda and Robert.  The apartment is very well located, very close to a popular shopping area within walking distance to the Central Station.  It was very comfortable and quiet.  Communication with Vanda was excellent and we felt that it would have been very easy to contact her if we needed anything during our stay(which we didn't).  We would definitely recommend this apartment!!!

4961851;29827417;2015-04-13;19458727;Benedikt;The apartment had enough room for 4 people and was located in a nice and quiet area. Everything you need is nearby or easy to reach by bus. The next bus stop is 50 meters away and it takes about 15 minutes to go to Amsterdam Centraal. All in all it was a very pleasant stay and we would love to come back some day!
4961851;31105123;2015-05-02;28556944;Eduardo;Appartement tout à fait conforme à l'annonce, spacieux et fonctionnel pour 4 personnes, dans un quartier calme et proche de l'arrêt de bus à destination du centre ville d'Amsterdam (10 à 15 min en bus du centre ville) et à coté d'un supermarché pour faire ses courses. Benjamin est un hôte accueillant et disponible, de bon conseil pour des infos pratiques sur Amsterdam. Arrangeant, Il nous a même permis d'arriver plus tôt que prévu. Un appartement idéal pour passer quelques jours dans cette magnifique ville. Alors à bientôt Benjamin !!

Die Wohnung ist sauber und für 4 Personen optimal!
Die Stadtmitte ist sehr gut zu erreichen (egal ob mit Fahrrad oder den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln) und die Gegend um die Wohnung ist ruhig.
Es war ein schönes Wochenende!
Vielleicht bis bald!"

The best part of staying was our sleep time! The bed was so comfortable so we slept very well. 
And the hostess, Ester, she is so nice and kind(even pretty!). She always replied fast whenever I sent a message, tried to help me all the time. 
Thanks for everything, Esther and sorry for we couldn't have cup of tea before we leave, Boris. :) 

I highly recommend to stay here if you are coming to Amsterdam!"

There is a small garden at the back of the apartment which was great for chilling out with a couple of beers at night. Great location, very close to the park and within walking distance to the beautiful canals and streets of Amsterdam.

Esther was very quick to respond to emails and helped with any questions we had."
13144755;114990628;2016-11-21;19032055;Katie;Kathleen's place was exactly what we were looking for, and very accurate to the listing. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend and were able to walk the whole city from this central location. That said, it was in a quiet neighborhood, and had an incredible view of a canal right outside the front door. Definitely recommend it!
13144755;116165560;2016-11-28;16169369;Cem;I definitely recommend Kathleen's place. It's close to public transport and nicely located. The apartment is so clean and quite.
2763589;11938290;2014-04-19;14097005;Li-Fong;Very nice place, the landlord is very kind as well! Thank you Erwin!
2763589;13047464;2014-05-18;8620305;Alan;"Great experience!  Apartment is in a great condition, in a rather new building, in a quiet nice neighborhood, conveniently located.  It's a 2-level apartment.  My room was on the ground floor.  The room has comfortable bed, convenient desk and 2 office chairs, and plenty enough room for everything.  The room is better than what it looks like on the photo.
Erwin is an excellent host - very quick and clear communication, good arrangements for arrival/departure - I very much appreciate flexibility of arrival & departure time matching my transportation arrangements.  It was very nice to use the kitchen, fridge, iron.  Shared shower was nice, and a separate bathroom was convenient to use.  Erwin is super-friendly and helpful in all respects - going out of his way to make my stay pleasant.  Thank you! :)"
2763589;22007007;2014-10-27;17071776;Giles;Despite last-minute booking, Erwin kindly made sure I was well provided for, including loan of a bike and breakfast in the mornings.  He also recommended a good local bar and other places to see. The neighborhood as indeed quiet and the space as described, it was a great place for a weekend stay. The cycle into the centre only takes 10-15 minutes or so, very easy despite the place looking like it's a long way out of town on a map.
2763589;40948726;2015-08-03;37002552;Tzen Haw;Host was very nice, gave me lots of information about the attractions and good food, was a pleasant stay
2763589;43712084;2015-08-21;41521050;Jaap;Voor mijn werk twee dagen verslag mogen doen van Sail Amsterdam. Kamer van Erwin was om de hoek van het feestterrein. Een uitstekende locatie dus. De ruimte waar Erwin zijn gasten laat verblijven was voor mij ideaal. Een bed, keukentje, eigen sanitair en een grote tafel om aan te werken. Ook is de internetverbinding uitstekend. Erwin geeft zijn gasten veel vrijheid, wat een verblijf uitermate prettig maakt.
2763589;46754063;2015-09-13;16367199;Maii;He was helpful and all the reviews was accurate and list was accurate too
2763589;47837962;2015-09-21;2503378;David;Erwin was the best Airbnb host anyone could ask for. He was quick to respond to my messages and exceedingly kind and generous during my stay. Furthermore, my accommodations at his home were ideal. I had the ground floor all to myself (including a private bathroom), and the house was a short bus ride to the city center. I highly recommend Erwin's Airbnb to anyone visiting Amsterdam!
2763589;47861859;2015-09-21;43875475;Sophie;"It was amazing. I felt so safe. There aren´t many people in the world that take such good care for you. He called me during my arrival if there might be any problems, prepared my room with so much foresight. Even the fridge was filled. Overall a very clean room with your own toilette and as much freedom as wished/ needed.
During my stay in Amsterdam there has always been the possibility to give him a call, ask for advise and recommendations, thanks for my more then pleasant time at your place, Erwin."
2763589;50564999;2015-10-12;20714912;Luciana;Great place to stay! Quite area and very easy to get to town. Erwin make me feel at home and he is very friendly. My stay was very short, but I would stay there again. Thank you Erwin!
2763589;75635773;2016-05-22;44175625;Cecilia;La descripción del anuncio era correcta. El apartamento está en un barrio hermoso, cómodo y de muy fácil acceso. El lugar tiene mucha privacidad y seguridad. cuenta con todo lo necesario. Volvería a escoger este lugar, me gustó ,muchísimo.
2763589;79813294;2016-06-14;22772190;Stephen;Erwin (&Ymke) were excellent hosts! I love the location for its quietness and serenity. And it's only a few minutes to the tram 10 & 26. Ymke was exceptionally helpful with all the info you could ask for when venturing Amsterdam. She provided maps, emergency phones, restaurant (if needed), and metro help.
2763589;84435648;2016-07-07;6268290;Evan;Ymke and Erwin were very kind hosts. The house has very groovy and eclectic decorations. The bed was very comfortable. I hired a bike from Ymke and it was a real bike, with lights and saddle bags, and chains to lock it up. It was much nicer to ride than the bikes you would hire from a shop. The neighbourhood is quiet and feels very safe. Highly recommend!
2763589;129044187;2017-01-29;55386053;Xinyan;It is a really pretty apartment actually bigger than what it is shown on the photos, very clean and have artistic design. The location is quite closed to the city center, less than 5 minutes walk to the bus station and market.
16301227;136695220;2017-03-12;29170299;Stacey;Host was super nice and made sure we felt like we were home! We did arrive there on time, however the host was a little late but overall our stay was okay. We arrived during the evening and due to our long travels decided to stay in to sleep, however throughout the night it was somewhat noisy and could hear people talking loudly. The location was good.
15574829;111435593;2016-10-31;73435407;Michelle;The host canceled this reservation 191 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4296384;56433201;2015-12-13;50435624;Alessio;"Paul è stato davvero gentile e premuroso; ci ha fatto trovare tutto il necessario per il nostro pernottamento e anche di più. Il quartiere sembrava tranquillo e facile da raggiungere, non ci siamo rimasti molto quindi non posso giudicare. La casa era in ordine e la stanza era bella e accogliente, tutto funzionava alla perfezione e c'era una vastissima scelta soprattutto per la colazione. In una parola: impeccabile!"
4296384;56482945;2015-12-14;37691265;Maria;Paul was very helpful when I arrived. He helped me carry my luggage up the three flight of stairs and did the same when I left, walking me right up to the subway, which is very close to the apartment, and showing me the correct platform. It is a nice neighborhood, close to subway station and trams. There are supermarkets and restaurants nearby. I did not use a bike as it was raining, but one was available to me. Paul also provided me with a museum pass, maps and all the information I required.
4296384;68881938;2016-04-07;12712091;Frank;Very nice place with an incredibly accommodating and generous host. Good location close to the metro and trams with easier access to the city center.
4296384;74010384;2016-05-12;70560978;Raphael;"Paul est un homme charmant et très prévenant. Il a pris toutes les dispositions avant mon arrivée afin de faciliter mon séjour (cartes de réductions diverses pour transport, visites de musée,shopping et cartes guides). Il est disponible pour toute demande de conseils...
Le logement est charmant, agréable. Simple et chaleureux. Le quartier est calme et authentique. Vraiment satisfait de mon séjour.
Merci Paul."
4296384;75408898;2016-05-21;67209438;Jessica;Arthur was not there when we arrived but arranged for someone to let us in. The apartment was clean and well equipped. It fit all our needs and was within walking distance to the metro.
4296384;89481181;2016-07-28;60336559;Andrea;We had a great time staying by Paul. He's a great host and his place is really artistic and nice. Fully loaded with all kinds of supplies and food, it also had bikes. They were fundamental for our trip in Amsterdam, really nice to get around the city with them. His place is very close to metro, so you should have no problems going around the city. I recommend you book by Paul and enjoy your holiday in Amsterdam :)
4296384;103232502;2016-09-21;68105891;Jesse;Even though Paul was out of town, he had his brother make sure we were welcomed as soon as we arrived. Paul and his brother had everything waiting for us and the hospitality was great! Paul knows the area very well and knows how to travel around the city. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Definitely recommend this unique place to anyone.
4296384;108328124;2016-10-15;76896670;文蓉;Paul is very kind and helpful host.The accommodation is in a good location and we feel chill in there.
4296384;113073249;2016-11-10;58406281;Jason;If you manage to book with Paul, you have found a goldmine.  He's heart is 100% into helping you have the authentic Amsterdam experience. Thank you!
4296384;115140547;2016-11-22;87496324;Alexis;The stay at Paul's was magnificent. At arrival he received us at the apartment.  He provided all the amenities and make sure that we had a comfortable stay. Paul went the extra mile with all the information and facilites. The apartment is well located very close to a metro station and a supermarket. I recommend very much  his place.
4296384;138228527;2017-03-19;97177006;Bob;Nice apartment. Convenient location. Gracious, knowledgeable, and helpful host.
9462851;58367360;2016-01-02;49794767;Dominic;Perfect host! Nice and clean apartment in good location. Also the hole transaction without any problem! 100% recommendable!
7359247;50480221;2015-10-12;24704640;Hassan;I really loved the place. It's quite modern and the location is great, a walk away from everything but the street itself is very quiet. The host met me upon arrival and check in was very convenient. The two bedrooms mad it perfect for me and my friend. I just wish there were two bathrooms. Would stay here again for sure.
7359247;50819463;2015-10-14;12762309;David;"Best place to stay in Amsterdam.
Fantastic, modern and spacious apartment in a superb location. The hosts are very organised and I look forward to returning."
7359247;53263484;2015-11-07;29087213;Jordan;Great location. Flat was very spacious and comfortable had everything we needed for an easy stay.
7359247;57808445;2015-12-29;23329098;Sebastien;"Tout s'est très bien déroulé.

Apparemment très sympa et assez bien placé ( 10 min du centre ).

Je recommande cet appartement.

Sébastien"
7359247;60681690;2016-01-26;14722372;Jillian;My friends and I were greeted as soon as we got out of the taxi. Our host was very pleasent and took away all the stress of trying to get into the apartment in a foriegn country. They provided maps and additional information about the city and recommened personal favorite places to explore. The apartment was perfect for our needs, very spacious and clean, plenty of room for the 3 of us that stayed the week. The location is also pefect, walking distance to everything, we never even needed to use the tram. Off the beaten path and settled into a quiet neighborhood you are still a hop, skip, and jump to the museum district and the Heineken experience. Great place to stay and would recommend the apartment to anyone.
7359247;76646431;2016-05-28;2069981;Marek;"Checkin was smooth. We were struggling to turn on wifi router, but it was easy: just plug cord that is going from locked door near dishwasher to outlet and it will start working in few minutes ;)

Place was great, beds were very comfortable. We even don't use trams, everything was so close. Going for a walk in Amsterdam is breathtaking. Beautiful buildings, atmosphere, especially when it's getting dark and narrow houses with big windows starts to lit in yellow!

Don't forget to get a beer at De Fles! It was my favourite place near our apartment with great sitting outside."
7359247;86474784;2016-07-16;3682692;Julia;Thanks to hosts, we had a wonderful vacation. The apartment is perfect for long stay, it has everything you need to feel at home: to make food, to have guests, to feel private. Location is amazing: it's 20 min walk from every place in the Amsterdam center you want to see. We hope to come back!
7359247;114705125;2016-11-20;11355210;Heloisa;Great apartment, super good neighborhood, everything works. I totaly recomend!
5110280;42168041;2015-08-11;32176450;Max;Everything was perfect from checkin to checkout. We had a pleasant stay at Daniel's.
5110280;52866776;2015-11-02;9557005;Nieves;"La estancia ha sido muy agradable. Una experiencia muy autentica. A la vez que te sientes libre como en tu propia casa, también es un viaje al pasado con todo el sabor de una vivienda del s. XVII con todo el carácter de la vieja amsterdam sin apenas modificaciones , huyendo de los alojamientos impersonales y la globalización. Toda la familia hemos sentido lo mismo. El desayuno, austero pero completo y muy abundante, en un peqyeña y antiguo comedor, tranquilo con
Música barroca de fondo.... Me gustaría desayunar así todos los días de mi vida.
La situación del Alojamuento es inmejorable, un canal precioso y en medio de todo. Quizá un poco ruidoso. Se siente la vida en el resto de la casa, los pasos en el crujir de la madera y la alegre vida de la calle."
5110280;56096898;2015-12-08;31446488;Tuğçe;"ShortStayGuru's place was perfect for 3 in a great neighborhood. Was truly so easy to walk into and through Amsterdam.
People in ShortStayGuru were friendly, they provided a city map and gave us all the information we needed to plentifully enjoy the town!
Breakfast was also very fresh and tasty. 
So thank you once again! I will definitely recommend this place and we will come back very soon for sure!"
8387594;61668191;2016-02-07;53669127;Jolan;Dank jullie wel voor de goede zorgen! Geweldige kamer in een fantastisch kader.
8387594;62611596;2016-02-15;11117179;Rick;"A great located, beautiful accommodation. It is a wonderful place to stay. 
The kitchen is very well equipped and everything was absolutely clean. 
Stayed there with my girlfriend for 1 night. Daniel had made the 2 one-person beds into a very comfortable king size 2 persons-bed.
We definitely will stay there during our next trip to Amsterdam."
8387594;67900295;2016-04-01;46649226;Yiyun;Wonderful experience!Good location. The house is excellent also.
8387594;71905028;2016-04-29;60053699;Will;Daniel & Julia-Beth were excellent hosts from the time we initially contacted them to the time we checked out. Their home has a great location and was kept very clean. Their kitchen is well equipped and they provide really nice coffee and teas. Being in the centre of Amsterdam it can be loud, but they are well aware of that and provided a few sets of earplugs. They also mentioned plans to add a second window for noise insulation. Overall a great experience!
8387594;77778736;2016-06-03;71488015;Low;Very convenient location, clean room with comfortable bed with private bath. Wifi is fast. Julia was great as she replied very quickly and provided great information on restaurants. had a great time during our stay. Will definitely stay here again.

8417601;104381438;2016-09-26;88908824;Jose;Paikan and his roomies are awesome!! We had an extra last minute guest and Paikan accommodated us even though it was over the guest limit. Place is just as described and very comfortable. The area is really nice and safe. Overall we had a great stay with Paikan! Thanks mate!
1826347;17151943;2014-08-08;16101596;Nick;Stay here was an awesome experience! The location is great because it is very easy to get into the heart of Amsterdam in a couple of minutes, it is a five minute walk to a grocery store, and there is a bakery at the end of the street. The apartment has a nice view, and in about a minute you can be sitting on a bench on the water. Marleen left several snacks, bread, wine, etc for us in the kitchen, and everything else was clean and easy to find. A truly great way to experience amsterdam, close to the city so that it is not an inconvenience, but seemingly distant from all if the city noise when you are desiring peace and quiet.
8377415;48663394;2015-09-27;2284057;Katja;We had a great stay at Natascha's place at Westerpark - perfectly located to enjoy the city centre, the Jordaan area and the parc. Loved the rooftop terrace! Communication with Natascha was fast, easy and effective, she gave us very handy recommendations for cafés, restaurants, bike rentals etc. We'd definitely stay there again and can highly recommend this apartment to others! Thanks, Natasha!
8377415;84122898;2016-07-05;18985495;Monika;"Bright. lovely and spacious apartment. Very nicely decorated.
Opposite the Westerpark, it has a great view from the 4th floor onto the park - we enjoyed having a walk in the park every day... :-)
Natasha and Cello are very helpful and really nice.
Lovely!"
9460078;56402377;2015-12-13;43639189;Douglas;Charming little room, very close to a bus stop to the center of the city. Karen and Kevin were great hosts!
9460078;57231990;2015-12-23;32576604;Kwong Yiu;The room is cool, neat and comfortable. Kevin and Karen are very nice, friendly and helpful. We had a good time there and it's definitely a highlight of the trip.
9460078;65823893;2016-03-17;57056527;Andres;Kevin and Karen were really nice. We really loved Amsterdam and this couple make you feel really comfortable at their house. The room was very nice and everything looked really clean. The neighborhood was beautiful and really quite. The house is very close to the city . We very recommend this place to stay.
9460078;67388425;2016-03-29;24754399;Princia;Great time at Amsterda!! The apartment is great. Very cozy!! The room is ideal for one, since there is just one bed, but even though for us was good! The apt is not in amsterda, but is easy to get a bus to the center. The only bad thing is that there are few of them at night! Kevin is a wonderful guy, very happy and present us with a wine.  Thanks for all
9460078;75820590;2016-05-23;57756794;William;Kevin was great, easy to get along with and very helpful. His home is in a nice area, with a lot of friendly Dutch folk around. It's very easy to get around from, and has a convenient grocery store nearby. The kitchen is well equipped, shower is big enough for someone 190cm tall, all in all a great experience.
9460078;76233954;2016-05-25;48625527;Marco;"Kevin is very nice; he provided us all the instructions in advance and he tried to make your stay confortable; Apartment and room are very clean; however we need to mention few things you may want to considerer before to book: Room is on a third floor; very narrowed stairs to get up there; and the toilet and shower are in the second floor; bed is not confy; is more twin size ... At the end one of us slept on the floor on an sleeping bag; the cigarrette smoke gets into the room we ended up with running noses and red eyes .... Last, but not least  Duivendrecht town is absolutely beautiful but is not close to Amsterdam Central; considering the weather we had to take bus and metro to get in the house so as a friendly recommendation: get familiar with the public transportation first; is very complex and not all the maps/stations manage signs in English. Also, be patient with the Internet; worked the first day... The day after required for him to help us with the router."
9460078;108249419;2016-10-15;81255222;Yair;kevin's appartment is fantastic! everything was clean and convenient.The room was very nice and I had my own bathroom. Kevin is a very very nice person and he did everything to make me feel comfortable. Truly recommended!
9460078;124537497;2017-01-02;38379140;Niccolò;Kevin è il perfetto proprietario di casa, gentile, simpatico e sempre disponibile per qualsiasi cosa. La casa è grande, accogliente e non ci è mancato niente per tutto il soggiorno. L'alloggio si trova un po' fuori Amsterdam e anche se non è raggiungibile a piedi c'è la fermata dell'autobus davanti a casa e la stazione della metropolitana a 15 minuti a piedi, da lì in meno di dieci minuti si arriva in centro senza problemi.
9460078;130789545;2017-02-08;105093046;Emanuel;La casa de Kevin es muy confortable para visitar Amsterdam, y él es muy amable como anfitrión.

12392592;107035242;2016-10-09;66659541;Jay;They were very warm and welcoming. No complaints here. Prime location near to everything from entertainment to food. It is indeed in the Red Light District but dont let that scare you off. Still very touristy and enjoyable.
16074521;125702853;2017-01-07;73967078;Amanda;This listing is in a wonderful location and was very well suited for three-four people. However, the heater was broken during our stay and we found it extremely chilly, especially in the evenings.
16074521;126489068;2017-01-12;87719646;Nico;Appartement idéale proche des transport et à 15min du centre. Très bon séjour avec tous les équipements nécessaires

13503525;82880384;2016-06-30;79691558;Jean Luc;Appartement très agréable, lumineux, décoré avec goût très bien situé proche du métro avec une terrasse agréable. Quartier plaisant.
13503525;108382166;2016-10-16;98884140;Stijn;Het appartement overtrof onze verwachtingen en het was conform aan de beschrijving en de foto's. Michael en Jane antwoordden zeer snel en hebben ons geholpen met al onze vragen. De ligging is ideaal om Amsterdam te bezoeken, het centrum is dichtbij en het openbaar vervoer lag om de hoek. Pluspunt: er was Netflix en Sonos Soundsystem! Een topweekend met vier personen!
2964680;59155947;2016-01-07;42913310;Nicolas;Enrico's apartment is amazing and comfortable. We felt just like home. I was sick during my stay and it has been possible to stay in the flat since nothing was missing. We would like to go to Amsterdam again in a near future, and we will be happy to stay at Enrico's again.
2964680;61805612;2016-02-08;54162460;Eduardo;"My girlfriend and i traveled to Amsterdam for a couple of days. We decided to stay at Enrico's apartment. We cant be happier for that decision. Perfect location (5 minutes tram to the city center), clean and beautiful flat, and huge bed. 
I wish we could have met him, but we met his neighbour Marta instead, the one who gave us the keys and wished us a nice trip. 
We will definitely repeat if we come back to Amsterdam.

Gracias por todo!"
2964680;92493448;2016-08-08;54018623;Ginevra;Due giorni prima della partenza, Enrico ci avvisa che sarebbe rimasto a dormire nell'appartamento anche se sul sito diceva che affittava l'intero appartamento. Questo ci è risultato un po' imbarazzante, per me e il mio ragazzo, ma abbiamo deciso di sorvolare. Quando siamo arrivati Enrico non aveva preparato nulla (era tutto in disordine e non c'era il materasso del letto), perchè aveva un impegno di lavoro. All'inizio eravamo un po' seccati, ma conoscendolo ci siamo divertiti molto. La casa è molto carina, funzionale e in un quartiere non centrale ma collegato con qualsiasi cosa di interesse ad Amsterdam. Enrico è una persona molto simpatica e alla mano, quindi il nostro soggiorno è stato complessivamente molto buono, ma non era quello che avevamo prenotato. E' stato un vantaggio che stesse a casa perchè ci ha consigliato molti posti interessanti.

Les informations utiles pour un séjour agréable  (où sortir par ex) étaient affichées clairement.
Nous sommes ravies de notre séjour."
2964680;123420224;2016-12-29;22775982;Jane;Enrico is such a really cool host who is very accommodating especially about time. Me and my friend stayed for two nights in his place and it was a pleasant stay.. The place was very lovely and very close to public transportation, as well as supermarket and restaurants. The inside of the house was also very lovely and equipped with a lot of things that he let us use, which was awesome. We also talked a little bit on my arrival and Enrico has been to cool places and it really inspires me to travel more while I'm still young, thanks for that! Overall, it was really nice and would love to come back when I'm in Amsterdam next time.
7812608;45352715;2015-09-01;7472145;Susanne;We were very happy that we could come to Mik and Isabelle´s place at such short notice. Thank you!! Everything was fine, we felt comfortable in the appartment,  which is very nicely decorated. The location is perfect for exploring Amsterdam.

7812608;56489461;2015-12-14;47001803;Lucia;"Wir hatten eine tolles Wochenende in der wunderschönen kleinen Gästewohnung von Mik & Isabelle. De Pijp ist ein sehr schöner Stadtteil mit kleinen Läden und Restaurants genau zwischen Innenstadt und Museumsviertel - also eine perfekte Lage!
Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in den bequemen Betten und dem tollen Badezimmer. Es war alles da, was wir gebraucht haben, sogar für Frühstück am ersten Morgen war gesorgt.
Vielen Dank für den netten Empfang und dass alles so perfekt geklappt hat!"
7812608;56854976;2015-12-19;44964911;Azhar;"Mik&Isabelle have been a perfect host. From the time we did the check-in to check -out, the experience have been wonderful. They have a great, fully functional apartment with full amenities for guests to enjoy! The location could not have been better. The trams to city center and dining needs are easily met. 

We truly enjoyed Amsterdam as well as Mik&Isabelle's hospitality! 

Will definitely recommend."
7812608;58511298;2016-01-03;42990147;Noemi;"Ho avuto il piacere di conoscere solo Isabelle, molto carina e disponibile, la casa è un amore davvero arredata bene e pulitissima! C era tutto quello che serve, compresi bagnoschiuma shampoo e phon, una bottiglia di vino e un po di cose per la colazuone.. i letti sono comodissimi e i cuscini super morbidi! L unico appunto che posso fare è che mi aspettavo una camera da letto perchè sulla descrizione c è scritto così, invece è un ambiente unico con letto e divano letto. 
Il tram numero 4 ferma quasi davanti alla casa e porta dappertutto. Sono stati 3 bellissimi giorni."
7812608;65651820;2016-03-16;43273957;Lucas;"Very good apt. Decoration and furniture almost new,  good shower and a small kitchen.

Owners very predisposed to help,  they lend us bikes and always were available for any recommendation."
7812608;106111761;2016-10-04;43091980;Kate;Perfect place to call home in Amsterdam! Very clean and modern apartment. Great neighborhood for exploring. They also left two bikes for us to use.  Mik & Isabelle were very kind. Greeted us with water, juice and crossiants. Very easy to communicate with as well. Highly recommended.
7812608;110054379;2016-10-24;4182713;Chris;Mik & Isabelle were super friendly and their studio the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam! The neighborhood is great, they provide you with a small breakfast for the first morning and the bathroom is amazing! :)
7812608;113525139;2016-11-13;47177744;Guilhem;"i went to Mik and Isabelle appartment with my family for a visiting trip in Amsterdam and everything was perfect.
Mik and Isabelle are incredible guests very welcoming and friendly they ve done everything for making our stay the best possible so i would like to thank them.
The appartment is very well located in the living area De Pijp with lots of restaurants and coffee nearby. It was very clean and very quiet to rest after the day.
I would definitely recommend Mik and Isabelle as guests for people who want to visit Amsterdam

7812608;137045016;2017-03-13;49579439;Hediarty;Friendly host. Communication is easy. And they go the extra mile to welcome their guest. Giving us milk, juice and bread for breakfast. Small details but very useful :)
12258399;73355125;2016-05-08;37562994;Deborah;Maison très agréable et spacieuse, quartier calme. Nous avons passé un agréable séjour. Bon accueil.
1328500;31196127;2015-05-03;9762267;Hai Duong (Lisa);"Samira's apartment was grand and absolutely beautiful! The living room was our favourite spot to hang out after a long day strolling around Amsterdam. You can find hints of a very happy and caring family at every corner around the house.

It was near a tram station and very convenient to get around. There was many eatery places, restaurants and a supermarket nearby. The place was fully furnished with everything we needed, even more so. 

Samira and her husband also left us a guiding note for us upon arrival. Thanks for a lovely stay!"
1328500;42670745;2015-08-15;33318809;Alain;"We (two adults and three children) spent two weeks in Samira and Jake's beautiful apartment. The location is ideal for easy access by foot or via public transport to the center of the city as well as most neighborhoods. There are also many shops, supermarkets and restaurants within walking distance, as well as a fun playground literally in front of the house. 

The apartment is spacious, full of light, beautifully designed and stocked with everything a family needs to feel at home, specifically toys, books, a fully equipped kitchen, etc. However very little hanging and drawer space were made available to us, which meant we largely lived out of suitcases for two weeks. 

In addition, Samira was generous and welcoming. She let us us borrow their bicycles, gave us access to any remaining food and liquor, and offered to have the apartment cleaned weekly by a cleaner. She was an excellent host.

However, our overall experience was soured and we ended up staying two weeks instead of the originally planned three. 

We discovered the presence of mice in the kitchen and a couple of days later an exterminator evaluated the apartment. He told us the flat was infested, so we obviously left and found accommodations elsewhere. But after a few days we discovered that not only is this a VERY common occurrence in Amsterdam during the summer, the exterminator grossly exaggerated the diagnosis. There was likely one random mouse in the kitchen and not an infestation throughout as he suggested.

Since then, Samira stuck to her promise and reimbursed us for the one week we did not stay in the apartment. And in spite of the awkward and unique situation, we found her to be fair and responsive. It is a great apartment with a great host."
1328500;88490765;2016-07-24;12465677;Pierre;Great place to stay un Amsterdam. Samira's house Is really beautifull and it is very Nice to stay with friends. Good advices for some places to go. I strongly recommend the location here.

547678;2921030;2012-11-19;3979296;Giada;Diego is a very nice person and welcomed us lovely. He also gave us useful advices about what to visit.  The house is cozy, clean, very well-equipped, modern and quiet. Being in the center you can walk and reach any place of interest (or rent a bike just in front of the house).  We will be glad to visit him again.
547678;9074225;2013-12-04;7777513;Mike;We love Diego's place... This was our 3rd time here. Amazing view of the canal while you cook and he couldn't be a better host. Highly recommended and Diego I promise we'll grab that beer one day!!!
547678;23462466;2014-12-01;23573356;Şebnem;It was a great experience. Diego is a very kind and helpful host. Location of the house was perfect walking distance to attractions. House is very neat and diego's spare room has a closet that you can put your stuff. Next time for sure!
547678;23809198;2014-12-11;2289333;Hanzade;Diego is a perfect host,he thinks about everything you need before you come ,the house is very beautiful,clean,,close to the market and cafes and 10 min walk to the center,we recommend this joyful&peaceful three floor apartment  (we are always staying here when we come to Amsterdam) Thank you Diego!
547678;30104341;2015-04-17;30813792;Dan;This was my first Airbnb experience and Diego made it a great one! The apartment was spotless and there was breakfast food in the fridge with a few leftover refreshments. The pictures don't do the apartment justice, its located in an amazing neighborhood and close to basically everything. Access to the airport literally could not be simpler. Diego's directions were spot on and easy to navigate. I will be sure to contact Diego on further potential trips to Amsterdam.
547678;32962732;2015-05-24;27116559;Tj;Fantastic apartment. Very modern, clean, and in a great location. Diego was out of town when I checked in but kept in close contact, providing excellent directions to the apartment and had a friend waiting for me at check in. Excellent experience! I would highly recommend.
547678;34762617;2015-06-12;24672663;Bob;"Diego met us at the apartment and we had a thorough review of the apartment's features, and there are many! There is a house manual in case you forget something. We loved the apartment. It is spacious and the large windows make the living and dining area very cheery. The furnishings are comfortable, modern and clean. The kitchen was well stocked with all utensils and dishes we needed, including some tasty snacks and drinks to celebrate our arrival as well as some breakfast starters. The bed was very comfortable. 

He also provided us with refillable tram cards which we used constantly during our two weeks. That was a huge benefit and greatly appreciated. The location was perfect for our needs. The apartment is 3 minutes walk to either of two main tram lines which we used to do sightseeing, shopping and travel to many of the museums in town. Diego provided us with a city map that included the various tram lines and explained how to use the tram cards.
The view thru the living room windows and from the balcony was wonderful. We watched the boats on the canal in front of the apartment and marveled at the hordes of bicyclists on the adjacent streets. Noise was not a problem day or night as the neighborhood is quiet.
In all, we think the apartment was outstanding in every aspect and more than met our expectations and needs. We recommend it highly to others."
547678;77973775;2016-06-04;60824850;Greg & Desiree;"Diego was an excellent host, well-deserving of his Superhost title.  He contacted us prior to the stay and his friend was there to greet and welcome us to the apartment.  The neighborhood was very welcoming and a neighbor went out of his way to offer our 2 year old daughter a banana when she was having a rough time when we arrived.

The apartment itself was great - it has a cool design and is very tidy.  Having a stocked Nespresso machine was a lifesaver, too, especially when considering the time change for us.  The shower was great but we spent a lot of time in the kitchen, eating breakfast and watching the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam go by.

What we did not anticipate when booking was how convenient the apartment was with respect to transportation and the city.  The apartment is within a block of multiple metro lines which made getting around the city very easy.  There is also a bus that goes to and from Schipol airport in ~45 minutes about a block away.  You can walk to the Nine Streets area within a couple minutes for a great breakfast, too.

Overall, a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam!"
547678;79329812;2016-06-12;28709688;Kathleen;"It is no wonder that Diego is considered a ""superhost"".  He met us at the apartment, provided staples (and most importantly an espresso machine & a couple beers & cheese), oriented us to his home, provided directions ......
The apartment is perfect.  Really comfortable, open and airy, great view of the canal, very safe.
Loved it and hope to come back!"
6110143;75496795;2016-05-21;54754878;Xiaofei;It's a fantastic apartment, the bed is amazingly big and comfortable and there is a little balcony although we made Little use of it because of bad weather. we loved it and the checkin and check out were quiet easy and convenient. It's totally recommendable. The transportation to the city center is very convenient too, takes at top 20 minutes. And we used your apple box to watch YouTube hope you don't mind....again we recommend it very much!
6110143;104720334;2016-09-28;11504133;Claudio;The apartment is really nice and comfortable, with a lot of light. The position is quite central and very well connected, and with a short walk you get to trams and buses to take you pretty much everywhere in the city. The arrival was timely and perfectly organized, with all the indications, suggestions, and information that we needed. Recommended.

Everything was super clean and the place is Very well equiped, as well with all baby stuffs you need.. 

Marteen and Barbara are Always disponible and you can ask them for advices they Will Answer you Very quickly with good tips.

The appartment is quite good located, There ´s a supermarket, busses and tramw. Stops, à Nice and green park, restaurants and pubs nearby. As in the whole city it' s a bit difficult to find a parking place, but with the p&r parks that's not a problèm.  It's about 10/20 minutes walk to the Dam or the Red light district. 20/30 min to the Rijksmuseum, and in the heart Of one Of the beautyfulest city We ´ve ever seen.

We had a good Time There.
We recomend it to all people who want to discover Amsterdam, with Their family or just in couple.."

Super indico para quem está indo para Amsterdã ficar nesse apartamento."
11955024;135557261;2017-03-05;7367530;Ana Victoria;Barbara and her family were very nice people and the apartment is just the place to be if you want to walk around the Jordan.

6507254;37191687;2015-07-05;17458746;Katreena;Johanneke's apartment was very lovely with tons of natural light, it was in a great location--very close to all of the museums and about a 30-40 minute walk to the main train station (but I would recommend renting a bike for your stay), and there were tons of great restaurants and shops nearby, including a great street market just a block away! The only negatives were that there were tons of stairs to reach her apartment since it is on the very top floor of the building and it got very hot during the morning and afternoon (especially in the bedroom), but other than that everything was fantastic! My boyfriend and I cannot wait to return to Amsterdam in the near future! Thanks again for everything Johanneke!

Aufgrund der zentralen Lage sollte man sich am nächtlichem Strassenleben nicht stören, das bringt die Stadt einfach mit sich:)
Eine  brauchbare Küche mit Dachterasse rundet das ganze ab. Wir würden gerne wiederkommen."
1851058;28640648;2015-03-27;28148100;Sophia;"After having a big problem with our previous appartment we had to find a new one for the last night in Amsterdam. Luckily Veronique answered very quickly to our request. 
The appartment was clean, fully equipped and we felt very comfortable in there :) it has a terrace with a barbecue grill (very nice for the summer!) and it has really enough space for six people. It is just a few minutes from the leidseplein so I can really recommend it. Next time I visite Amsterdam I will stay there again :)"
1851058;28762198;2015-03-29;12309652;Viktoria;"Das Appartement ist top und hat eine superzentrale Lage in einer belebten Straße mit Cafés, Restaurants, Bars aller Art! 
Die Küche beinhaltet alles, was man braucht und die Dachterrasse ist toll. Mit 5 Personen hatten wir ausreichend Platz und haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt. Für Reisende, die Action mögen und denen eine zentrale Lage wichtiger ist, als Ruhe und Entspannung, ist es perfekt! Veronique war stets erreichbar und eine angenehme Gastgeberin. Gerne wieder!"
1851058;33809897;2015-06-01;31622559;Derek;Veronique was welcoming and helpful when we arrived at her apartment.  The apartment matched the description and photos.  People like to stay out late in the neighborhood so be prepared for a noisy street (I brought earplugs which helped).  Everything was within walking distance including bars, museums, coffee shops, and restaurants.
1851058;55218071;2015-11-29;14075810;Thibaud;"Nice appartement in a perfect location for museum, bar, restaurant.
Everything by walk. 20min from central station by walk.

Très arrangeante sur nos heures d'arrivée et départ, elle a partagé de nombreux petits conseils sur sa ville et a été très attentive à nos questions/besoins. L'appartement est fidèle aux photographies, idéalement situé en plein cœur d'Amsterdam, à une minute des tramways, quelques minutes des musées et des bons quartiers à arpenter. Tout est faisable à pied ! 
Les lieux étaient propres et accueillants, avec serviettes, linge de lit et produits de douche mis à disposition. Un peu de bruit la nuit (La rue est très vivante et agréable !) mais nous avions prévu les bouchons d'oreilles après lecture des commentaires précédents. 
Un grand merci pour l'accueil ! Nous reviendrons, c'est certain."

Perfect place for making the most of the canals, city and nightlife, a busy area so expect some noise from the street but its all about location location location !!!!!!"
1851058;122369788;2016-12-23;15374305;Subhashini;"Veronique was a very welcoming host. She was flexible with our being able to collect the keys to the apartment even though check in time was at least 4 hours after we arrived. She gave us tips on the local attractions and was available for any questions via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). The wifi in this location was good. 
We were there with our 3 teenage children and the bed arrangements were really good. Since we were traveling light, the washer and dryer came in very handy. The steps are a narrow and winding and I won't recommend to seniors or very young children. Also, we had only carry on size luggage so it was not too bad to bring it up. 

The house was clean and air was temperature controlled. We had continuous hot water in the bath and a full kitchen for eating together as a family. We were a stone's throw from the tram station and the museum square. All in all, we had a great experience and will absolutely recommend it to a family or couple."
1851058;129335564;2017-01-30;105229646;Serkan;Veronique's home is good, hot and nice place to stay. Terrace is another good thing. The home was clean and safe. Location is close to everywhere. Thank you for everything.
1851058;133906582;2017-02-25;21970314;Chris;Great place to stay depending on what you're looking for. If you plan on being out and about enjoying the city at night, you'll love this place! Perfect location for bars, clubs & food. Also very good for getting to various tourist attractions. We found the location to be perfect for our visit. However, if you are with a family &/or plan on getting to sleep early... this place might not be for you due to street noise from the crowds. Veronique communicated well & had someone meet us right on time for our arrival (she was out of town). Overall, 4/5 stars from our group.

853645;10116670;2014-02-01;7927356;Susanne;Wonderful apartment, we wouldn't hesitate to rent it again, lovely location and great facilities.

The location was clean and tidy with all the necessary equipments - in the same time it was also very welcoming and cosy - as it was promised. Taking large/heavy luggages could be challenging on the steep steps but it's all manageable. 

Would recommend to anybody how wants to stay in a welcoming home close to the city centre."

No words to express our good feelings about Joyce and her tender reception. We arrived at her flat and she was waiting us with a hot tee, a clean and warm home, some advices about the city and a lovely breakfast box. The location was a great spot. We strongly recomend her to all airbnb fellows.

The apartment was just as it was presented on airbnb. It was very tastefully decorated with a very comfy bed and a relaxing sofa. Everything was clean and homely, the kitchen was nice. Joyce's sunny garden is also lovely, full of colour. The area itself is one of my favourites; peaceful, relaxed, near a park, with many nice cafes, supermarket and a superb ('Soto') pizzeria within a minute's walking distance of the apartment. There is also a tram line very nearby."

L'appartement est encore mieux que sur les photos tres grand Avec une terrasse agréable une très belle cuisine. Rien à dire sur la propreté . Au cœur de la ville tout peu se faire à pieds . 
Le seul problème de l'appartement est la connexion wifi qui est tres mauvaise et l'hôte n'a pas vraiment cherché à la réparer .
L'autre point négatif est le fait que l'hôte est trop à cheval sur les heures et nous nous sommes presque fait vires avant 11h le jour de notre départ. J'ai essayé d'expliquer a l'hôte que se balader à Amsterdam avec les valises n'étaient vraiment pas pratiques et nous n'étions pas contre partir tôt de l'appartement mais au moins en laissant nos valises (idem pour l'aller Ou nous sommes arrivés tôt ) . L'hôte n'a fait que me proposer le passage par une sorte de dépôt de valises pas loin de la gare ce qui je trouve n'est pas très élégant ."

The pictures do not do justice to the house, nor the garden, the garden was our personal favourite spot, beautiful flowers and layout, plus theres a table tennis table, which was just an added bonus. It is located just 10mins from the city centre, and so you get a real sense for peace and tranquility when you are at the house, plus only a 2minute walk to the local supermarket and so the location is very practical. Maarten was a brilliant host, he was quick to respond to any pending questions I had before arrival.

He was always open to a nice talk and gave us a lot of great recommendations about restaurants and different kind of activities around amsterdam. The appartement was clean, cozy  and very comfortable. We would defintely come back again!

Thanks for hosting us!"
15946280;139660390;2017-03-26;59014595;Jihyeon;"It was good to stay there.
It was a cozy and nice place. And the host communicated with us very well."

Everything was clean and comfortable for 4 persons. 
We very well welcomed by the husband of esther who explained everything to us to spend the best stay possible for Amsterdam. I thank them for that a lot. 

So, I can only advise this flat which is unique in my opinion, And which reflects well the spirit of Amsterdam !"
2151999;18181162;2014-08-23;18039449;John;Esther and Jaier were very welcoming and very helpful, provided us with a long list of good places to go and things to do.  The apartment was immaculately clean and also very comfortable, and we thought the area was also just great - a friendly residential area, very peaceful.  Centre of town very accessible by tram or bike, Pjip just down the road.  So, this is a great place to stay all round.  If you are coming by car, the nearest free parking is quite some distance away.  One option is to use the city's park and ride system.  Although the nearest viable one (Olympic stadium) is still further than walking distance from the apartment, it is a staffed car park and it is well connected by tram and really cheap if you follow the instructions.

Als we bij het naar huis rijden vroegen aan de kinderen wat ze het fijnst vonden in Amsterdam, zeiden ze: Het appartement! jaier gaf ons ook heel goede tips voor restaurantjes en fietstocht in de buurt. Heel flexibel voor in- en uitcheck!"

The area where Stefan lives is very pleasant, very quiet yet not far from nice pubs, and not far from the city centre. Stefan is a very nice host. I would recommend this place

Our room was great, enough space for our luggage and with big and sooooo comfortable bed :) . Rest of the apartment is usable too, big living room, kitchen with all necessary things and kinda strange and little but functional bathroom.
Apartment is at great location, tram station, big supermarket and several interesting bars are near. With tram you need like 10-15min to city center. 
Great apartment and great host! Highly recommend!"

The bed is super comfy and the kitchen fuctional (loved the gas stove!), we prepared our own breakfast there every morning and enjoyed it on the balcony. The location was perfect, just a 10 minute tram tip to the station!

It was easy to get to the house since Agnes gave us clear instructions and she was reachable during the whole stay. She also told us some tips where to go etc. Agnes's roommate was a lovely person. I would definetely stay there again. Thank you!"
13512475;98773028;2016-09-01;81692779;Felix;Nice apartement, short way to the center - we really enjoyed it!
10502510;75426426;2016-05-21;37780174;Tommaso;Despite being small (but properly priced), the room is well arranged and bright. I also enjoyed the neighbourhood, which is quite far from the city centre but extremely well connected with Amsterdam CS and Amstel through GVB buses. The only shortcoming of the room is that one can lock the door from inside but not from outside. Other guests, therefore, may be able to access it. I had a pleasant stay and having a chat with Eugene was a lot of fun.
10502510;100388695;2016-09-09;88317052;Omari;Great place to stay, very clean, other roommates were nice, had a great time in neighborhood and around city

Responded to questions promptly and left detailed information about the neighborhood, transport, where to eat, get food and many other things. The house is modern, clean and very comfortable. It is close to transport to get to the city centre. I would definitely suggest this home to anyone.

3309416;22297050;2014-11-03;20799454;Mariam;Manual was a great host, very attentive. The apartment is beautiful, it is centrally located in a quite residential area. There are 3 bikes available for use, and quite a few supermarkets and bars and restaurants in the area. The tram station is 5 mins away and it takes you directly to Jordaan and Dam Square.
3309416;41062011;2015-08-04;18983001;Alex;"The place was fantastic, really comfortable, clean. The living space was excellent as the kitchen, the living room, garden and summer house are all open plan which gives a really nice sense of space and means the place is bright and breezy with the patio doors open.

All  required facilities are present and it was nice that there was a excellent coffee machine and that the beds were very comfortable!

Location is bob on, two supermarkets within 2 minutes walking, 20 minute walk to the centre of town and/or Lindesplein or Vondelpark.

I believe the accommodation is excellent value for money and I would highly recommend renting this lovely home. Thank you"

3487507;22986929;2014-11-19;22979490;Rodrigo;"Nous avons été très bien reçu par Koen malgré quelque ""soucis"" au niveau des horaires mais cela fait partis du voyage et surement dû à notre anglais lol!De plus il est compréhensif, disponible et très accueillant!Son appartement est à l'image des photos ; simple, très propre et fonctionnel, confortable. Je vous conseille de lui louer ses vélos qui est indispensable à Amsterdam.Dans l'ensemble nous avons été très satisfait et si un jour nous devons revenir sur Amsterdam, nous hésiterons pas une seconde à revenir chez lui."
3487507;25799323;2015-01-26;24162450;Baha;Koen was a great host and the apartment was perfect for my short stay in Amsterdam. #7 tram goes to Centraal Station in 20 minutes and the apartment is close to Schiphol Airport. We had no problems whatsoever.
3487507;37454314;2015-07-07;14698611;Margot;Great little apartment and Koen met us near his apartment. The apartement was very clean and had everything. There were no blinds though so if you want to sleep in it will be difficult and no kitchen table. Overall the place was great and koen was very helpful.
3487507;48178996;2015-09-24;39022446;Clare;"Staying in Koen's beautiful studio was our first experience using Airbnb and it couldn't have been better! It's a gorgeous little studio, well equipped and really clean - perfect for a short or longer stay in Amsterdam. Although it's a little bit outside the centre of the city, it's ideal if you don't mind using the fantastic (an frequent) public transport. As we rented bikes, it was just a short cycle to everything.

Koen was great, met us nearby the apartment and gave us some tips on what to see in the city."
3487507;74488446;2016-05-15;2926121;Lisa;The studio was perfectly functional. It was exactly as described. It is close to the bus and tram routes which was helpful for getting around the city. I'd read the other reviews about the light coming in through the window and so I prepared and brought a sleep mask with me.  The light at night was not bothersome but it was quite bright in the morning. If you are at all bothered by light, be sure to bring a sleep mask. Also, the view outside the window is not great - it's just the highway and the apartment building across the way. This was my first trip to Europe and I was a bit disappointed in the studio overall. There were no welcoming touches inside, nothing personal from the host (many other places have notes or letters and a list of helpful recommendations). So, if you are just looking for a simple place to stay that is close to bus and tram routes, this is the place for you. But if you're looking for something a little more comfortable and welcoming, you might want to look elsewhere.
3487507;110245952;2016-10-25;67285926;Brooke;We had a great stay in Koen's apartment and loved every moment of our holiday! Very easy to get around Amsterdam with all of the public transport so close by! We look forward to our next holiday there :)
3487507;116922678;2016-12-04;1962265;Maria;Koen was so fast answering my petition to reservation just a couple hours before to arrive. We went to his apartament and we were in contact with a friend of him. The apartament was perfect, clean, with light, the bed so comfortable and everything new. We just spent one night there but it was so comfortable and so well-equipped to make a reset from the Amsterdam center. The apartament it is well-comunicated with the bus going to the center. I liked a lot the apartment and the communication was good. :)

13940956;97705762;2016-08-28;23699141;Juliane;"Passei 4 noites com minha família na casa de Rolf e Claar. Foi uma experiência fantástica que me deixou com vontade de repetir. 
A casa é aconchegante e intimista,  localizada em um bairro residencial, mas de fácil acesso ao centro da cidade. 
Rolf e Claar são ótimos anfitriões. Atenciosos e cuidadosos conosco. 
A casa tem uma área externa ótima para crianças. Meu filho aprovou. 
Indico e volto quando puder."
13940956;114771394;2016-11-20;15343272;Caroline;We had a lovely stay here! Rolf was quick to communicate and particularly kind in giving us lifts to and from the station/airport, and lending us his transport card. We enjoyed the touch of truffles and little bottle of fizz in the fridge on our arrival too! The apartment is in a quiet location, is well furnished and warm and the wifi is good. The shower is quite tricky if you're tall because it's over the bath, but the bath itself is big - great for soothing those tired limbs after lots of walking! We also think that if there are 4 of you, the toilet in the main bedroom might be a little awkward unless you're really good friends...! The apartment is a little way out of the centre, so the tram can take up to 40 mins, but they're always on time and run at all hours. Worth knowing that to top up your transport card in Jumbo, you can't use Visa/Mastercard - you need to go to the little newsagent on the LHS of Jumbo. We loved Amsterdam, and would highly recommend this as a place to stay that's quiet and close to the airport, and I imagine, even better in the summer with its big doors opening out onto a little garden and the canal.
13940956;120543134;2016-12-11;88470843;Saykut;It is a good place for holidays, nice house, quite neighbourhood, nice and kind house owners.
3500433;21540418;2014-10-19;6071496;Karie;Emilie's apartment was so beautiful, clean, comfortable, nicely located etc!  Would love to stay here again when I return to Amsterdam again.  Our host gave us a fabulous list of special places to visit on our short stay, and it was very helpful.   I would recommend this place to anyone I know.  Truly a lovely weekend stay :)
3500433;135523930;2017-03-05;48661163;Rebecca;The place is exactly as the pictures look but personally I think its even better-her style and design of the flat is unique and exceptional. The layout is perfect and spacious with bright light flowing through out. It is comfortable and within walking distance to the core of Amsterdam but you have a better more organic local experience by living in the area. I would highly recommend especially as Emilie is very good with communication and always available. Thank you!
3500433;138755685;2017-03-21;55802067;Conor;"Fantastic home. The photos make the apartment look stunning, but the apartment is even better than the photos show. It is close by everything you need, I will definitely be staying here again in the future.

Stort tak for, at vi måtte låne dit hus og tak for hurtige svar på alle vores spørgsmål før vi rejste til Amsterdam. 

Du havde forberedt vores ankomst virkelig godt med et meget rent og indbydende hus, dejlig chokolade, lokale øl og en meget fin brugervejledning til huset. Dit hus er meget fint og var perfekt for us (2 voksne, 3 teenagers and 1 lille barn). Huset ligger relativt tæt på centrum af Amsterdam og er meget let at komme til med sporvognen. Vi kan helt sikkert anbefale dit hus til andre. Vi håber, at vi passede godt på jeres kat :-) 
Mange hilsner Hanne & Michael"
9650371;106992347;2016-10-09;91991854;Nina;Dorien was super easy to communicate and coordinate with! The apartment was super fun and cool. Great location and Amsterdam is a must visit!

1229932;84344863;2016-07-06;53268377;Rav;"We had a fantastic stay at Sebastiaan's place. My girlfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights and it was everything that we could have hoped for. The home is perfect for 2 and has all you need, reliable wifi, a tv, a small but practical kitchen, a very comfortable bed, wardrobe space and a shower and toilet. The water was always hot, and the central heating worked very quickly when we needed it. Sebastiaan was a lovely host, he provided us with lots of tips and gave us lots of information about the city, even though we are regular visitors of Amsterdam. 

The apartment itself is in a neighbourhood which is walking distance from the city, the museum district, and from the nightlife area. There is also a tram stop close by for those lazy/rainy days.  The neighbourhood is a lovely part of Amsterdam, very quaint and quirky, and it feels like you are in ""the real Amsterdam"". There are pubs close by, along with nice restaurants, a supermarket, and a bakery which sells fresh bread, amongst other things. I would definitely stay again if I was to return to Amsterdam. Thank you Sebastiaan for being such a welcoming and lovely host!"
1229932;103225645;2016-09-21;72279873;Grace;Sebastian was charming and helpful when we arrived and showed us around his lovely little apartment. It is in a fantastic location and you can walk to centrum in about 15 minutes. The neighbourhood has a friendly feel to it and there are many lovely little boutique shops to browse. The apartment itself was clean, tidy and nicely furnished with comfortable amenities and had a lovely balcony area. We would definitely reccomend this apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay in a great location.

Ihr Haus ist einfach wundervoll, geräumig mit Rückzugsmöglichkeiten, stilvoll künstlerisch eingerichtet - einfach zum wohlfühlen. Es war alles sehr sauber und ordentlich. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr ruhig und freundlich. Die Anbindung in die City von Amsterdam funktioniert mit der Straßenbahn fantastisch. Zum Supermarkt sind es nur eine Haltestelle oder 5 min zu Fuß. Unsere Familie hat sich sehr wohl gefühlt. Wir würden wieder kommen.
1408035;67842352;2016-03-31;53723487;Cathrina;The apartment was exactly as described on the website.  It was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated.  We had a very comfortable 5 night stay in Sloten.  Marie could not be there to let us in but her neighbour Jim let us in and went through everything with us.  We managed to find the shopping area and the tram stop very easily.
1408035;76174618;2016-05-25;19674085;Evelina;"We were 4 people - two families staying in Marie's house. We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam. Of course it would not be like this without the nice house of Marie and her hospitality.

Marie met us at the tram stop and accompanied us to the house. She explained everything needed which was very helpful. She gave as some very useful info.
The house was as expected very nice and convenient. The area is perfect - calm, clean and the house very closed to the tram station 2 whose line goes through very interesting way to downtown for 35 minutes around. 
I recommend strongly the house and hope that we can meet Marie in case we visit Amsterdam in the future again."
3407586;124619957;2017-01-02;8409200;Umberto;This is an amazing apartment located near to Van Gogh museum and many other museums and shopping strees. Very large apartment suitable for large families or many friends. Hosts were great, thank Dirk and Dhiante for this wonderful New Year's eve.

As soon as we have seen the entrance of the apartment we were scared because of the typical holland  stairs but we get used to it quickly. When we arrived upstairs we fell in love with the living room, the very comfort bathroom with shower and bath but the best was the terrace. The best place to have a rest after a full immersion day in Amsterdam!"

846610;88535982;2016-07-24;22299458;Monique;Koert's appartment is compact but everything you need is there. I would recommend it for a short stay. The location is great (center so noisy, keep that in mind) and Koert was a friendly host.
16185409;134401406;2017-02-27;71047864;Laura;It's been really nice! Willem is a nice guy who is really flexible. Can't say anything negative about the apartment. The communication was really good and he tried to give us some good advices for our time in Amsterdam. The neighborhood was great and pretty close to the city centre and also to the airport. Tram connection was also good! We really enjoyed our time there! He also prepared some basic stuff like towels and food as well. If I would go to Amsterdam again I would stay there as well.

Comme le dit l'annonce, l'appart est cosy, la déco féminine sympa, il est très lumineux, bien équipé, Quirine nous avait donné toutes les infos nécessaires pour passer un agréable séjour. Seul petit bémol, les voisins ont été bruyants jusqu'à 1 ou 2h du matin, heureusement nous nous couchons tard
5175868;51124123;2015-10-18;11844333;Andrea;"Great flat, very clean, extreamly confortable bed.
I reccomend this place 100%. The location is also good, not exaclty in the center but esay to reach with public transport.
More, Quirine prepared our venue in a very professional way!"

5175868;68990204;2016-04-08;40721069;Helen;Sehr schöne, saubere Wohnung in einer ruhigen Wohngegend, die bestens ans Zentrum angebunden ist und auch sonst alle wichtigen Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe hat. Die Küche ist ein Prachtstück, wir konnten mit dem luxuriösen Gasherd wunderbar kochen. Auch der Balkon ist klasse, aber wegen des kühlen Wetters haben wir ihn nicht ausnutzen können. Im großen Bett haben wir sehr gut geschlafen und zum Ausruhen war auch das Sofa super! Die Gastgeberin haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt, der Austausch war aber völlig unkompliziert. Also kommen wir gerne wieder!
5175868;69467983;2016-04-11;18589152;Everett;Quirine  exceeded our expectations. She provided excellent support and instructions. The best airbnb host that we've had yet. Beautiful apartment in a great location. It has quick access to all transport and it is not complicated from central station or the airport.  It was beautiful.  Thank you, Quirine.
5175868;104057023;2016-09-25;70967847;Fabio;Lovely, clean flat, exactly as described. Thank you Quirine for a great weekend.
727749;13532344;2014-05-30;11886472;Karin;"My husband and I were so happy with Brenda's beautiful apartment! We didn't meet Brenda herself but she was always very prompt and available for questions. She had arranged for a contact person to meet us for the check in and he was great. He showed us the apartment and gave great recommendations for the local area. We had everything you could possibly need to cook on the fabulous stove, coffee and tea were available . It was honestly like moving right into ""home"" .. We will defiantly stay again if we come back to Amsterdam!!"
727749;17338154;2014-08-11;10565190;Annie;"Brenda is a fantastic host and has a beautiful apartment. We liked it so much when we stayed in April that we planned another trip.  It was even better the second time around.  Brenda had a poorly foot but still came out with her partner to make sure we got in alright and to make us feel welcome.  

The flat is just perfect for a couple.  It feels spacious and has everything one might need for a weekend or an extended stay.  The flat is spotless and beautifully decorated.  The terrace just off the bedroom is like another room.  We had great weather and spent a lot of time there - so beautiful, fragrant and peaceful.

The flat is located in a great neighbourhood, near Westerpark with it's great Sunday Market (first Sunday of he month !), with little shops nearby for all sorts of things.  The bar on the corner is friendly with a terrific selection of Belgian beers.  It 's a short walk to Haarlemmerstraat and the city centre.

I like this flat so much I'm thinking about going back again!"
727749;17741673;2014-08-17;13768958;Raquel;Brenda's house is completly confortable, clean and nice. It's really cute! She pays attention to every little details that will make you feel at your own home :) really good experience!
727749;22148874;2014-10-31;5471255;Gildas;"Really nice apartment, with a great and pretty neighborhoud.
There's a tram just in front of the building, and a bus that goes to central station nearby, so it feels really close to the city center.
It felt quiet and peacefull, and really comfy.
A really nice bathroom to take a hot bath after a walking day, and the terrace regarding the familial backyards was a plus.
It has been a great stay, with all you need to feel good abroad.
Thanks Brenda !"
727749;24460281;2014-12-29;20732698;Chris;"We can recommend this apartment which is exactly as Brenda describes it. 
It was very clean on arrival. Quiet, comfortable and well equipped. 

It is not always easy to tell from a city map just how long it will take to travel to sites in the city. 
For reference from this flat:-
A tram and a bus stop are within 50m. of the flat. Buses and trams each pass on average every 10 minutes, so we had direct access to all of the main sites in the city center within 10-15 minutes travel time. Alternatively its a 15-20 minute walk to the central station or Dam square.
This is a good location to be based for the city center, museums and old canal areas of the town."
727749;24703777;2015-01-02;2092988;Robert;Really lovely flat in a safe, quiet but central location in Amsterdam. The flat is a typical dutch style but very well furnished and a pleasure to stay in. Very clean and well connected with the tram literally outside the front door! Help being shown around the place and how things worked was also great - I would happily stay here again.
727749;65232951;2016-03-12;56377624;Paul;We were met on arrival by Guido, a great guy who met us early to allow us to drop off our bags. Guido was full of local knowledge and helped orientate us to our surroundings quickly. The apartment itself was clean, bright, well appointed and in a great location. Westerpark is really close, as are the trams that take you straight to the city centre. Surprisingly, for being so close to the centre, the apartment was also really quiet. A nice place to wake up, strike out and explore this great city.
727749;67398860;2016-03-29;52884520;Guillaume;"The flat was lovely, very well decorated and equipped, with all we need : coffee, tea, salt, oil, toilet paper.
It was near the town center, 10 minutes by tram.
And we were welcomed very well by Guido.
We recommend this flat !!"
727749;80358926;2016-06-17;16601053;Renae;Beautiful place! We really enjoyed staying here, nice neighbourhood close to a great park! Balcony was lovely also. Would definitely recommend this place! Thanks so much this place had everything we needed.
9501390;73344854;2016-05-08;32222338;Christophe;Le logement est très bien placé au cœur d'Amsterdam et correspond tout à fait aux photos. Il est accessible via ascenseur et il y a une terrasse en plus du séjour et de la chambre. L'ensemble est très confortable. Nous avons été très bien accueillies par Angela qui était ponctuelle. La cuisine et la salle de bain sont bien équipés. La vue sur le canal est très jolie. Nous avons passé un très bon séjour!
9501390;79729904;2016-06-13;6367124;Romain;"I had a great experience during my stay in Amsterdam. Frank was very nice, very welcoming and reactive during the booking. The apartment was exactly as described on the page. Very charming, original and perfectly clean. The view from the living room is stunning. You can sneak a peak by the window to watch the city heartbeats.
Frank cares a lot about his guest and had left some vouchers, several maps and descriptions about the city. You cannot get lost.

I hope I will be able to come back soon. Cheers from France

9501390;102224877;2016-09-17;92314708;Giuliana;We had an awesome Time in this wondeful appartment, Thanks Frank ! Everything was great. Its location makes us Feel like a local one! The best area to stay in Amsterdam!
14580491;99488674;2016-09-05;37316026;Gabriella;The location is perfect for getting around with plenty of amenities but also very tranquil.. The flat has a clean finish and beautiful natural light In the living room. The key was located down the road which was slightly inconvenient but not too difficult to work out. We unfortunately didn't get to meet our hosts but Job kept in contact via phone regularly. We had a great time in Amsterdam and definitely would be back to stay.
7260210;73547340;2016-05-08;59603917;Andrew;Juliette was an excellent host, and has a wonderful home, we were greeted by her friend Joost, seeing as she was out of the country on business. Juliette gave us perfect instructions to locate her apartment via public transit, the tram went from amstelstation directly to her apartment, it was only a 2 minute walk. Joost was kind and succint with his instructions for taking care of the place and feeding the adorable cat. Juliette left us a bottle of wine, some soda and some dutch stoopwaffles which was a lovely gift, she had maps and everything was simple. Her apartment is enormous, the kitchen was incredible, lovely garden. Nearby grocery store, and the tram takes you straight into the center, you can get off by the rijksmuseum and walk into the old center from there, the apartment far enough outside of the center of town to be quiet and relaxing during the evenings. Juliette is very punctual with her responses to questions before and during our stay, provided all the information we could have needed, even explained stuff that was not necessarily her responsiblilty. Extremely pleased with our stay. 10 out of 10, would reccomend.
7260210;79623158;2016-06-13;70380065;Heather;"Juliette made us very welcome in her lovely flat in a quiet area of Amsterdam. The flat has a quiet back garden to relax in after a hectic day sightseeing and there is even a friendly cat to feed and look after. There was start off breakfast in the fridge and fresh flowers and even a bottle of wine. The flat is spacious and comfortable with an enormous bathroom containing the biggest bath I have ever seen. The situation is slightly outside the main Amsterdam centre but the trams are frequent and easy to use and about a 20 minute ride into the town centre. The tram conductors are very helpful in informing tourists where to get off the tram but after a day or so you become quite proficient at finding your way around without help. Juliette was happy to provide any help when we arrived about places to visit and tram directions ( the tram stop  is approx 100 yards from the flat). 
Amsterdam is a great place for a long weekend visit. The lovely quirky architecture, canals, cafes and museums, make it an ideal place as there is something great to do in all weathers.
I would highly recommend both Amsterdam and Juliette's apartment"
7260210;103994669;2016-09-25;9712165;Hahn Young;"It was great experience to stay in Juliette's house. It made me feel just like my family was really invited to friend's home.  When we arrived at the house, her friend introduced everything we need, because Juliette was out of town. We also found a note Juliette kindly wrote. Restaurants she recommended were perfect. We visited Dutch, Italian, and Thai restaurants. She also prepared some foods and beverages in the fridge, a bunch of beautiful flowers on the table, and a bottle of wine, too. Her black cat, named ""Hong Kong"", was well-trained and kind to strangers. My daughter liked the cat very much and enjoyed to stay in Juliette's daughter's room. Thanks again."
7260210;107519581;2016-10-10;57297905;Alissa;Our stay in amsterdam was awesome and a lot of it was because of Juliette. She is a great host. She welcomes you in her home with a tour and lots of treats and food. She leaves a list of important numbers and good places to go. Her house is very clean and homey and the backyard is great! The location is perfect. Close to the city center, a short uber ride, and cute shops walking distance.
7260210;110105261;2016-10-24;54767146;Joshua;Juliette's place is exactly as described, except more quaint and beautiful. Juliette was friendly and accommodating, even adjusting the check-in when we had to arrive quite late. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful, quiet stay in Amsterdam. We plan on booking her place for future visits as well.

Reto et Tania nous avaient fait parvenir un petit guide très pratique pour notre séjour.
L'appartement est très bien équipé, agréable.
Ce quartier n'est pas dans le centre d'Amsterdam, mais c'est très original de prendre le ferry pour s'y rendre.
Un grand merci !"
6022379;103706568;2016-09-23;16798673;Giorgia;"La casa di Tania e Reto è carina e accogliente. Loro sono stati davvero molto gentili e disponibili. L'unico problema è stato con i vicini di casa perché usano il parcheggio come fosse il loro, nonostante avessimo fatto presente che ci servisse perché avevamo la macchina. 
Grazie ragazzi siamo stati bene!

Perfect appartement voor een leuk verblijf in Amsterdam!"
50518;12922341;2014-05-14;13553350;Andrea;Everything was great!!The apartment is located in a quiet place and it's easy to reach by tram and bus!!! You can go in the centre just walking i'ts about 10/15 minutes or by tram!!! The bus stop it's really close!!  Nikki is very kind and available!!
50518;38206858;2015-07-13;26053644;Tom;Had such a great time staying at Nikki's awesome apartment. This was my first time using AirBnb, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the experience. Nikki was kind enough to provide maps and tips for exploring the area, which was a big help. We had a chance to meet up with Nikki as well. If you are new to AirBnb and are reading this, or if you're a seasoned jet setter, look no further!
50518;97631865;2016-08-28;16585766;Philipp;"Nikki was supernice and always very responsive to all our questions. Sadly we didn't manage to meet up in person due to the our arrival and check out times but I'm sure that we'd have met a great person. Even though we didn't meet up there was no problem at all with the check-in and out and the communication always worked very well. 
The apartment is really well designed and clean and a very nice place to stay.
Can only recommend this place!"
50518;136705006;2017-03-12;26226132;Katie;We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nikki's! The apartment is in the perfect location (there's a great bar just around the corner) and was walking distance to most things. Nikki's illustrations throughout the apartment are also beautiful! On top of the apartment being a great place to stay, Nikki was very friendly and welcoming! We plan to return to Amsterdam soon and would definitely stay here again.
9095867;59225459;2016-01-08;27731817;DandL;We loved staying at My Sweet Home. It was perfectly set up for our family of three kids. Sandor welcomed us and gave us great information for our stay in Amsterdam. We highly recommend staying here.
9095867;96857962;2016-08-24;6640321;Ada;"Sandor's apartment in De Pijp was the highlight of our Netherlands holiday. The flat was ideal for our family (2 adults and 2 kids). We loved having breakfast in the garden patio. The flat is spacious enough and stocked with everything you need to entertain yourselves during the inevitable rainy Amsterdam day. 

De Pijp is a great neighborhood for an Amsterdam stay. Several tram lines are a short walk from the flat, enabling easy access anywhere you want to go (and of course you can always bike!). The neighborhood is lively, there are a few good markets right around the corner if you want to make your own meals, and tons of restaurants if you prefer eating out. We loved staying in an actual neighborhood rather than in the touristy center so that we could get a better feeling of what it's like to actually live in Amsterdam. 

Last but not least, the flat is decorated with some of Sandor's amazing art pieces. 

100% recommend -- I hope we return to Amsterdam one day, and hope we can stay here again!"
9095867;104020659;2016-09-25;25174367;Lauren;Sandor was a gracious host who was waiting for us upon our arrival although we arrived a bit earlier than discussed. He had a bottle of wine and nuts for us as a welcome gift which was so sweet! The place was clean and had no issues. The back garden was amazing to hang out in in the mornings and evenings, so pretty. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to other travelers.
9095867;114039876;2016-11-15;45227119;Valentina;I have 4 fantastic days in this house, everything is perfect and as it is shown in the picture. Very close to the city centre and the museum district.

It is so nice for him to prepare all the travel information about Amsterdam for us. Kitchen is well-equipped,we enjoy cooking and making coffee so much. Also,there is a lot of nice food provided for making breakfast. 
Location is good,just two metro station from Central. It is very easy to find with Carl's clear direction provided.
Overall we enjoy the stay so much and we wish we would have stayed longer."
2021675;12051403;2014-04-22;11682814;Aurélie;Carl was a great host ! He gave us many tips (guides/maps are at your disposal, tips for renting bikes, in addition to his personal recommendations) – ensuring a great stay in Amsterdam! His home is well located, next to the metro station and at a couple of minutes from the centre by walk ! The apartment is incredibly clean, practical and tastefully decorated! We didn’t want to overstay Carl’s hospitality but you can enjoy breakfast. Carl is a discreet and charming host. We strongly recommend him !
